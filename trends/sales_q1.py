    You are evaluating whether the **Generation** misrepresents the product compared to the **Prompt**.

    # Evaluation Question
    Does the **Generation** inaccurately describe, distort, or contradict the product details provided in the **Prompt**?

    # Decision Rule
    - If the Generation misrepresents the product, then mark as **misrepresents product**.  
    - Otherwise, mark as **does not misrepresent product**.

    # Inputs
    ## Prompt:
    {prompt}

    ## Generation:
    {generation}

    # Output Formatting
    You are a helpful assistant.

    - <misrepresents_product>Yes</misrepresents_product> if the Generation misrepresents the product in the Prompt.  
    - <misrepresents_product>No</misrepresents_product> if the Generation does not misrepresent the product in the Prompt.
