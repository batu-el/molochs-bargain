        "article": "(CNN) -- Over the past few decades, there has been a shift toward more mountaintop removal coal mining in West Virginia. Mountaintop mining blasts apart mountains and deposits debris in nearby valleys to reach the rich coal seams buried inside. About 50% of U.S. power comes from burning coal, and about a third of West Virginia's coal is mined this way. But 57% of respondents to a CNN/ORC International Poll say they oppose mountaintop mining. Miners and coal companies say mountaintop removal projects provide much-needed jobs. Their opponents say the cost of those jobs -- to the environment and nearby communities -- is just too high. In CNN In America's documentary, \"Battle for Blair Mountain: Working in America ,\" Soledad O'Brien reports on all sides. For many in West Virginia, it feels like a choice: steady jobs or a healthy environment. What would you choose? Share your comments below.",

Agriflu, made by Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, is not intended to protect against the H1N1 virus, commonly known as swine flu. The vaccine was approved using an accelerated approval process, the FDA said. Novartis demonstrated that the vaccine induces levels of antibodies in the blood that are effective in preventing seasonal influenza, but it still needs to conduct further studies. Agriflu, for ages 18 and older, is administered as a single injection in the upper arm and is available in single-dose, prefilled syringes, according to the FDA. Novartis produces another licensed vaccine for seasonal influenza, Fluvirin, approved for ages 4 and older. Although no vaccine is 100 percent effective in preventing disease, vaccination is the key to flu prevention, according to the FDA. Novartis spokesman Eric Althoff said Agriflu is made in Siena, Italy, with eggs, and it has been available in Europe under the brand name Aggripal. This approval, he said, will add to future seasonal vaccine supplies.",

The Justice Department announced Wednesday that the oil giant agreed to pay $6.1 million after Environmental Protection Agency officials determined the company had not sufficiently reduced sulfur emissions in its refineries in Baytown and Beaumont, Texas; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and Torrance, California.

Qandil had been sentenced by a court to one year in prison for contempt. It said he failed to carry out a ruling to nationalize a private company while he served under now-deposed President Mohamed Morsy. Qandil was a little-known water minister who became the nation's youngest prime minister when Morsy picked him for the position in July 2012. Morsy, backed by the Muslim Brotherhood and the nation's first democratically elected president, was forced out of office in July, 2013, with detractors saying he was a tyrant trying to impose conservative values. Morsy is in custody, facing charges of incitement to murder in connection with protests against his rule last December. He has refused to recognize the court. The interim Egyptian government has cracked down on the Muslim Brotherhood, and in September a court ruled the group's activities are illegal. The military and police have detained large numbers of Brotherhood officials and supporters since the Morsy's ouster. Several hundred people have died in clashes between pro-Morsy demonstrators and security forces since the military removed him.",

The legislation comes in response to an effort this summer by a San Francisco Bay Area advocacy group opposed to the practice to get a measure proposing a citywide ban added to the November 8 city ballot. In July, a Superior Court judge ordered the proposed measure removed from the ballot, saying that male circumcision is \"a widely practiced medical procedure\" and that medical services are left to the regulation of the state, not individual cities. The legislation signed Sunday, which takes effect immediately, prohibits governments at the local or county level from \"restricting the practice of male circumcision\" and \"declares that the laws affecting male circumcision must have uniform application throughout the state.\"",

Mats Hummel opened the scoring in the 28th minute and doubled Dortmund's lead in first-half injury time. That remained the score going into the final 10 minutes and Kevin McKenna's 82nd-minute strike looked nothing more than a consolation for the home side. Youssef Mohamad equalized with two minutes left, reacting quickest from McKenna's header. However, Kevin Grosskreutz popped up to win it in injury time with a shot that deflected past Cologne goalkeeper Faryd Mondragon. That goal sealed victory for the visitors -- who remain fifth in the table, five points off the pace. Meanwhile, Kevin Kuranyi's goal early in the second half was enough for Schalke to beat Nuremberg 1-0 at home to continue their good recent form. Kuranyi scored the only goal in the 48th minute and the Schalke defence held firm to seal the points.

The trio undocked from the space station in a Russian Soyuz spacecraft at 10:02 p.m. ET, NASA said. They are scheduled to land in Kazakhstan on Saturday morning after spending 176 days in space and 174 aboard the station. An undocking glitch earlier had delayed the departure of Cmdr.

The meeting comes as part of Obama's outreach effort after Democrats were trounced in November's midterm elections. States could play a key role in cementing Obama's legacy.

The move, which reduces by three hours a day the time those beverages can be sold in stores, will go into effect at the beginning of September, RIA-Novosti said.

Fox has cancelled prehistoric dino drama \"Terra Nova\" after one season, ending months of will-they-or-won't-they speculation. Studio 20th Century Fox TV, however, says they fight \"Terra Nova's\" extinction event by shopping the series to other networks. The decision was handed down despite a few factors that were in the show's favor: A creatively strong two-hour finale, which won over many of the show's grumbling detractors; Fox cancelling Monday night veteran \"House\"; and another Monday sci-fi drama, \"Alcatraz,\" under-performing in recent weeks. From what we hear, Fox higher-ups weren't too fond of the show. \"Terra Nova\" will likely end up the highest-rated cancelled show of the season. It averaged 10.1 million viewers and a 3.6 adult demo rating once you add in a week of DVR playback. See the full article at EW.com.

Dr. Denham Harman, 98, developed the 'Free Radical Theory of Aging' in 1954, though it took years for additional research to prove its importance. The theory essentially says that a byproduct of oxygen utilization is adverse chemical reactions in cells, with the result being aging and, ultimately, death. Dr. Denham Harman (pictured in 2006) is seen on his 90th birthday celebration at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha . Harman officially retired in 1986, but he worked four days a week into his 90s at the University of Nebraska Medical Center — arriving each day at 7 a.m. He held both medical and doctorate degrees.

A court ruled in May that  Arpaio's routine handling of people of Latino descent was not tough enforcement of immigration laws, but instead amounted to racial and ethnic profiling. The sheriff's office had a history of targeting vehicles with occupants with darker skin or Latino heritage, scrutinizing them more strictly and detaining them more often, U.S. District Judge Murray Snow ruled. The sheriff's lawyers dispute the judge's conclusion and Arpaio is appealing the decision. Meanwhile,  the judge ordered a monitor to oversee retraining in the sheriff's office and the creation of a community advisory board. Over the next 1½ years, the county will have to pay $21,943,107 for the monitor and the retraining, according to county budget records. Each  year after that it will cost $10 million  to keep it going, according to Maricopa County spokeswoman Cari Gerchick. The money will come from the county's general fund, Gerchick said, and it's not clear if cuts are needed in other areas to find the money. Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, has a total budget of $2.2 billion.",

According to the FAA, the inspections will focus on pins which attach the horizontal stabilizers to the fuselage. They were prompted by reports that a coating used to protect the pins from wear and corrosion was applied incorrectly. The FAA says premature failure of the pins could cause reduced structural integrity of the horizontal stabilizer to fuselage attachment, resulting in loss of control of the airplane. The part number of each pin must be checked and pins with certain part numbers must be replaced with new, improved attach pins. The order, called an Airworthiness Directive, is effective May 20 and applies to Boeing 737 series 600, 700, 700-C, 800, 900 and 900-ER aircraft. The inspections are not expected to affect airline schedules. The aircraft included in the directive are relatively new, entering service in 1998 or later.",

The abuse at the HMAS Leeuwin naval base occurred mainly in the 1960s and '70s, according to a report released by a defense department task force investigating abuse in the country's armed forces. The victims, mostly aged 15-17, were junior recruits at the school. They were mostly abused by higher-ranking junior recruits, who were not reprimanded for their behavior, but staff also committed much of the brutality, the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce said. Investigators heard 238 complaints of abuse, which detailed instances of forced sodomy, naked beatings and brutal rituals including genital abuse, and verbal and physical intimidation. The nightmarish mistreatment scarred young men for life, many of whom sought solace in drugs and alcohol or, in later years, suffered breakdowns of their careers and relationships.

The first Starbucks opened in 1971, in Seattle, Washington. The name comes from Herman Melville's Moby Dick, a classic American novel about the 19th century whaling industry. The seafaring name seems appropriate for a store that imports the world's finest coffees to the cold, thirsty people of Seattle. Howard Schultz joined Starbucks in 1982. While on a business trip in Italy, he visited Milan's famous espresso bars and was impressed with their popularity and culture. In the 1990s the demand for high quality coffee allowed Starbucks to expand beyond Seattle, first to the rest of the U.S., then further afield. After becoming one of the first companies to offer stock options to its part-time employees, Starbucks became a publicly traded company.  E-mail to a friend .",

However, Indonesians -- including his onetime supporters -- were frustrated by his erratic and chaotic leadership. He was at odds with the nation's parliament, which eventually forced him to step down. Wahid was known for injecting humor into his religious sermons and political speeches.

After the compass was found to be safe, it was returned to the owner, he said. Customs and Border Protection officers wear radiation devices, similar in size to pagers, to detect possible threats.

The state, which voted for President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, is a significant pickup for Republicans. This election cycle saw more than $100 million spent on TV ads for both candidates. Polling from recent weeks showed Gardner holding a slight lead against the incumbent senator, even though most fell within the margin of error. Udall spent much of the race trying to define Gardner as too conservative for Colorado. The one-term senator slammed Gardner repeatedly for co-sponsoring a \"personhood\" bill. Yet his effort to get women to turnout quickly backfired after Gardner softened his opposition to birth control restrictions. Udall's \"war on women\" strategy was one reason the Denver Post chose to endorse Gardner, just six years after they backed Udall. The newspaper's editorial board justified their endorsement noting that Udall \"devoted a shocking amount of energy and money\" on a campaign meant \"to frighten voters rather than inspire them.\" View the full results .",
