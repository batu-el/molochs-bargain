{"article":"(CNN) -- Arsenal striker Eduardo has been ruled out for two weeks with a hamstring injury just days after returning from a broken leg.

{"article":"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- This could amount to some pretty pricey sushi. A giant bluefin tuna caught off the coast of northern Japan went for a record 32.49 million yen (about $396,000) at an auction Wednesday, the Tokyo Metropolitan Central Wholesale Market said. The price was the highest for a tuna since the market began keeping track in 1999. It all breaks down to about 95,000 yen per kilogram, or about $527 a pound, for the 342-kilogram (754-pound) fish. The bluefin, caught off Hokkaido in northern Japan, was \"an excellent quality\" said Yosuke Imada, the owner of the high-end Kyubei sushi restaurant in Tokyo.

A giant bluefin tuna caught off the coast of northern Japan went for a record 32.49 million yen (about $396,000) at an auction Wednesday, the Tokyo Metropolitan Central Wholesale Market said. The price was the highest for a tuna since the market began keeping track in 1999. It all breaks down to about 95,000 yen per kilogram, or about $527 a pound, for the 342-kilogram (754-pound) fish. The bluefin, caught off Hokkaido in northern Japan, was \"an excellent quality\" said Yosuke Imada, the owner of the high-end Kyubei sushi restaurant in Tokyo. The catch will be split by Imada and Hong Kong's Itamae Sushi chain. \"It became a bit too expensive,\" Imada said answering questions after the record bidding. \"But the people would talk about it a while.\" The New Year auction, the first of 2011, typically brings some of the highest prices of the year and is considered to be very symbolic.

Ratliff was co-owner of FPS Industries, whose website says it \"is proud to be world leaders in product development and testing for hard use firearms shooters.\" Investigators from many agencies -- including the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives -- are investigating, and the GBI said Friday that they are making progress in identifying the shooter. Several guns were found at the scene, but none of them were used to shoot Ratliff, the GBI said in a news release. Ratliff's YouTube channel had more than 530,000,000 views.

{"article":"Shola Ameobi agreed to join Crystal Palace in a deal that will see him reunited with former Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew. The striker left Turkish club Gaziantep in December and Selhurst Park has been his preferred destination for a Barclays Premier League return despite interest from West Bromwich Albion. Ameobi scored 79 goals in 397 appearances for Newcastle before leaving St James\u2019 Park last year after 14 years. Shola Ameobi has agreed to join Crystal Palace ahead of his potential Premier League return . The former Newcastle United striker\u00a0left Turkish club Gaziantep in December and has been looking for a club .

North Korea told the South to \"go back\" according to Lee Jong-Joo, a spokeswoman for South Korea's Unification Ministry, insisting they would not talk with anyone from the government itself. A delegation of twelve South Korean government officials and businessmen crossed the border into North Korea's Kumgang tourist resort to try to resolve a dispute over South Korean assets there.  The joint project was started in 1998 to boost reconciliation and give North Korea a chance to earn money. Seoul suspended tours in 2008 after a South Korean tourist was shot dead by a North Korean soldier after walking into an off-limit area. The last discussion at the Mount Kumgang resort was in April 2010 but that did not include government officials.  Pyongyang said last month it will cut off all ties with the government in Seoul, and it refuses to talk to anyone in President Lee Myung-Bak's administration.\n\n# Formatting Instructions\nYou are a helpful assistant.

Italian court explains Amanda Knox conviction . After her release from prison and return to the United States, Knox resumed her studies at the University of Washington. Her memoir recounting the ordeal, \"Waiting to Be Heard,\" was released in 2013. Last year, she and Sollecito were again convicted. Italy's highest court is expected to hear an appeal in the case on March 25 and decide whether Italy may seek to force her to return.

The front of Diao's vehicle was left in pieces after the incident, but the forward was said to be unharmed. Lazio teenager Keita Balde Diao has walked away unscathed after crashing his yellow Lamborghini . The front of Diao's car was left in pieces after the 19-year-old reportedly lost control of the vehicle . Diao - playing for Lazio against Bologna in May - has been linked with a move to Premier League Liverpool . Reports in Italy indicate that he lost control of the car and that he was below the legal limit. Diao has played three times for the Serie A outfit this season but is yet to find the net. Predominately an attacking player, he came through Barcelona's proficient youth system before joining Lazio three years ago. During his true breakthrough season at the Stadio Olimpico Diao turned out 33 times and was part of the side to make the knockout stages of the Europa League.\n\n# Formatting Instructions\nYou are a helpful assistant.

Director Michael Bay announced this month that she is being replaced as Shia LaBeouf's love interest by model-actress Rosie Huntington-Whiteley for \"Transformers 3.\" Fox portrayed Mikaela Banes in the first \"Transformers\" and its sequel \"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.\" Green spent a decade playing David Silver on the hit TV series \"Beverly Hills, 90210\" until it was canceled in 2000.

{"article":"A beached 30-foot sperm whale near Tampa, Florida, attracted hundreds of onlookers Thursday afternoon as biologist decided to euthanize the animal, according to CNN affiliate WTSP. Sperm whales are rarely seen close to shore, and this whale appeared to be emaciated, according to biologists. Because the large whale wouldn't have been able to survive on its own, veterinarians from the University of Florida decided to euthanize it.

Sperm whales are rarely seen close to shore, and this whale appeared to be emaciated, according to biologists. Because the large whale wouldn't have been able to survive on its own, veterinarians from the University of Florida decided to euthanize it. They gave the whale a strong sedative before administering a drug by plunging a 6-foot needle into the whale's chest cavity to stop its heart. \"Although it looks large and scary, it is a very humane thing to do,\" said Erin Fougeres, a marine mammal biologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Cathay Pacific Airways and Qantas Airways had canceled flights at Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, airport spokesman Andang Santoso said. Singapore Airlines said it was continuing to fly. Large clouds of gas and dust from Merapi's recent eruptions also have forced some flight cancellations into and out of the Yogyakarta airport. Travelers were asked to check with their airlines for schedule changes. On Wednesday, U.S. President Barack Obama shortened his visit to the Indonesian capital because of concerns that volcanic ash could ground Air Force One in Jakarta, according to administration officials. Recent eruptions of Merapi, which started on October 26, have killed at least 156 people, officials at Sardjito hospital have said. The eruptions also have displaced an estimated 200,000 people. The 3,000-meter (9,800-foot) Merapi, in Central Java, is famously unpredictable.

{"article":"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Air Force has grounded its entire F-22 Raptor fleet amidst continuing concern over how the fighter jet provides oxygen to the pilot, according Capt. Jennifer Faerrau, a spokesperson for the Air Force's Air Combat Command. The stand-down order was made Tuesday but is just now becoming public. It's unclear how long the stand down will last. There are about 165 Raptors in the fleet. Since January, the aircraft already had been kept at altitudes under 25,000 feet during an ongoing investigation into a November crash. Flying above that altitude could cause a pilot to black out from lack of oxygen and lose control. The stand-down affects all routine training and other missions, Faerrau said. The Air Force is looking at all the systems on this new-generation fighter jet, but one area of focus is the On-Board Oxygen Generating System (OBOGS), according to Ferrau. The order came from Gen. William Fraser, commander of Air Combat Command, which is based at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia.","highlights":"The stand-down order was made Tuesday but is just now becoming public .\nThe 165 Raptor fighter jets have been kept at lower altitudes during ongoing probe .\nFlying above 25,000 feet could cause pilots to black out .\nOrder came from Gen.

Jennifer Faerrau, a spokesperson for the Air Force's Air Combat Command. The stand-down order was made Tuesday but is just now becoming public. It's unclear how long the stand down will last. There are about 165 Raptors in the fleet. Since January, the aircraft already had been kept at altitudes under 25,000 feet during an ongoing investigation into a November crash. Flying above that altitude could cause a pilot to black out from lack of oxygen and lose control. The stand-down affects all routine training and other missions, Faerrau said. The Air Force is looking at all the systems on this new-generation fighter jet, but one area of focus is the On-Board Oxygen Generating System (OBOGS), according to Ferrau. The order came from Gen. William Fraser, commander of Air Combat Command, which is based at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia.\n\n# Formatting Instructions\nYou are a helpful assistant.

The Wrap first reported the news. The 'Men in Black 3' ending makes no sense, no sense at all . Oren Uziel, who is writing the upcoming \"Mortal Kombat\" movie, has scored the screenwriting gig for \"MIB 4.\" He is also writing Sony's sequel to \"21 Jump Street,\" last year's hit comedy starring Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill. That sequel will open on June 6, 2014. No release date has been set for \"MIB 4.\" Why Will Smith turned down 'Django' \"Men in Black 3\" was a box office success last summer, earning the franchise's highest worldwide gross. The time-traveling threequel brought back franchise stars Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, and also starred Josh Brolin as an uncanny younger version of Jones' Agent K.

Inflation was expected to ease slightly, however. The finance minister is expected to deliver the 2009 budget statement on Thursday.\n\n# Formatting Instructions\nYou are a helpful assistant.

Produced by Shakur's mother, Afeni Shakur, the musical is an original story about two childhood friends in a fictional Midwestern industrial city as they struggle to meet their dreams in the face of tough circumstances. RS: The 50 coolest summer jams of all time . \"Tupac was a prophet and I want everyone to see that,\" director Kenny Leon -- whose credits include A Raisin in the Sun and Fences -- told Broadway.com. \"[Holler if Ya Hear Me] is a present-day musical using all of Tupac's music, but Tupac is not a character in the musical.\" RS: Tupac Shakur's Godmother added to FBI Most-Wanted Terrorists List . Todd Kreidler, an associate director for Fences, wrote the book while choreography will be handled by Tony winner Wayne Cilento (Wicked, Sweet Charity). The musical is currently being workshopped with no theater or casting announced. See the original story at RollingStone.com.

They could have done with Power's flair and creativity as they failed to overcome Alloa in their underwhelming 1-1 draw at Ibrox on Saturday.

{"article":"CNN -- Ajax midfielder Evander Sno has suffered a heart attack whilst playing in a reserve match against Vitesse Arnhem on Monday. A statement on the club's website said the 23-year-old Dutch midfielder had to be resuscitated before later being transferred to hospital, where he is expected to stay for two weeks. The incident occurred after 60 minutes with Sno, who came on as a half-time substitute, having to be resuscitated three times. As a result of the former Celtic player's trauma the match was abandoned and he was treated on the pitch for more than ten minutes before regaining consciousness.

A statement on the club's website said the 23-year-old Dutch midfielder had to be resuscitated before later being transferred to hospital, where he is expected to stay for two weeks. The incident occurred after 60 minutes with Sno, who came on as a half-time substitute, having to be resuscitated three times. As a result of the former Celtic player's trauma the match was abandoned and he was treated on the pitch for more than ten minutes before regaining consciousness.

The arrest was made at Britney Spears home in Calabasas, California. Security personnel found Miranda Tozier-Robbins looking through the windows of the singer's home in Calabasas, California, the department said in a written statement. Tozier-Robbins also had a backpack and video equipment, the statement said. Security personnel asked her to leave, but she \"balked,\" the statement said.

{"article":"JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- Nelson Mandela's current hospitalization is due to a lung infection, authorities said Tuesday.

A beachcomber found the softball-sized eyeball on the sand in Pompano Beach, Florida, on Wednesday, speculating that perhaps it came from a squid. But experts who examined the eyeball made their call of swordfish based on the its size (softball), color (blue) and structure (presumably swordfishy), according to a statement from Joan Herrera, curator of collections at the agency's Fish and Wildlife Research Institute in St. Petersburg. Based on straight cuts on the bone around the eyeball, Herrera said, experts think an angler cut it out of a swordfish and tossed it overboard. The half-ton fish are frequently found in the Florida Straits off South Florida at this time of year, according to the statement.

{"article":"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- At least 441 people have died in floods in India from this season's monsoon rains, federal authorities said in their latest report. An Indian child plays in a flooded street in Mumbai earlier this month. Flooding has affected more than 1.5 million people in parts of India, said the disaster management division of the federal home ministry. The country's main weather office has warned of more heavy rain in western and central parts of India. Monsoon rains sweep across the subcontinent from June till September.

{"article":"Ciudad Juarez, Mexico (CNN) -- A former police chief known for battling drug gangs in the Mexican border city of Tijuana has been named the new top cop in Ciudad Juarez, another city plagued by cartel violence. Former Baja California state police chief Julian Leyzaola \"is our new boss,\" Juarez police spokesman Adrian Sanchez said Thursday. Sanchez said Leyzaola was credited with cleaning up Tijuana during his tenure there, and \"We hope he can do the same here in Juarez.\" Battles among rival drug gangs were blamed for more than 3,000 killings in Juarez in 2010. Leyzaola launched a public battle with one of Mexico's most wanted drug traffickers, Teodoro \"El Teo\" Garcia Simental, after he took office in Tijuana in 2008. Garcia's cartel threatened to kill five police officers a week until Leyzaola resigned -- but by January 2010, Garcia was behind bars. Leyzaola survived a series of assassination attempts and moved his family out of Mexico for a period of time, sleeping on an army base during that period.

{"article":"(CNN) -- Eight people were injured in an explosion at a naval weapons station's boathouse in New Jersey Tuesday morning, the U.S. Navy said. The blast at Naval Weapons Station Earle happened at about 9 a.m. while personnel were performing maintenance on a vessel, the Navy said in a news release. Seven sailors and a Department of Defense civilian firefighter were injured. Though all eight were taken to hospitals, none had life-threatening injuries. By Tuesday night, the Navy said seven of the eight had been treated and released after suffering minor injuries, mostly from smoke inhalation. One sailor remained hospitalized and underwent surgery for a broken arm, the Navy said. \"The situation is stabilized. We are investigating the accident,\" Navy spokesman Mike Brady said. Information on what exploded wasn't immediately available. Authorities are investigating what caused the blast, the Navy said.

The Frenchman will be back on the bench for second-placed Roma\u2019s clash with AC Milan at the Stadio Olimpico on Saturday. The former Lille manager's ban was lifted after the steward retracted his claims. Rudi Garcia has won his appeal against a two-match ban imposed for allegedly clashing with a steward . Roma's Greek left-back Jose Holebas also won his appeal. The former Olympiacos had been given a one-match suspension for his alleged 'provocative and insulting' hand gesture toward the Genoa fans.

{"article":"(CNN) -- The most senior surviving Khmer Rouge leader, Nuon Chea, has been declared fit for trial by a United Nations-backed court in Cambodia, the agency said Friday. Nuon, the right-hand man to late leader Pol Pot and a former Cambodian prime minister, is reportedly 86 years old and is accused of murder and torture. He waived his right to be present in court Friday because of health reasons, including heart disease, the United Nations said.

{"article":"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court will step back into the national debate over free speech and abortion, accepting an appeal Monday on the rights of protesters outside medical clinics. A challenge to a Massachusetts law concerns government-mandated buffer zones set up around facilities that perform abortions. Oral arguments and an eventual ruling are not expected until next year. The state's \"selective exclusion law\" makes it a crime for speakers other than clinic \"employees or agents ... acting within the scope of their employment\" to \"enter or remain on a public way or sidewalk\" within 35 feet of \"a reproductive health care facility.\" Anti-abortion activists say the law has kept them from talking with patients approaching the clinic entrances.

A challenge to a Massachusetts law concerns government-mandated buffer zones set up around facilities that perform abortions. Oral arguments and an eventual ruling are not expected until next year. The state's \"selective exclusion law\" makes it a crime for speakers other than clinic \"employees or agents ... acting within the scope of their employment\" to \"enter or remain on a public way or sidewalk\" within 35 feet of \"a reproductive health care facility.\" Anti-abortion activists say the law has kept them from talking with patients approaching the clinic entrances.

A cagey first-half exploded into life eight minutes before the interval when Juve midfielder Mo Sissoko received a second yellow card for a late challenge on Javier Zanetti. The 10-men bravely held out until the 75th minute when Inter took a stunning lead through defender Miacon.

The win, only Inter's fourth in 12 league matches, sends them back to the top of the table by two points from Roma -- who can reclaim top spot if they beat Lazio in the Rome derby on Sunday. A cagey first-half exploded into life eight minutes before the interval when Juve midfielder Mo Sissoko received a second yellow card for a late challenge on Javier Zanetti. The 10-men bravely held out until the 75th minute when Inter took a stunning lead through defender Miacon.

Richard Nisely and his wife from Newton Falls told WKBN-TV\u00a0they were picked up by police on an outstanding warrant earlier this week. A northeast Ohio couple said an intruder made themselves comfortable when they broke into their home - eating bologna and drinking some coffee before stealing some of their belongings . They secured the apartment when they left, but when the pair returned, the property had been trashed. Prescription drugs were stolen, along with a video game console, a DVD player and dozens of movies. WFMJ-TV reports police determined that someone pried open a side door and that, as the police report put it, the intruder 'was comfortable while they were there.' One of the residents suggested a possible suspect. Newton Falls police were investigating.\n\n# Formatting Instructions\nYou are a helpful assistant.

{"article":"(CNN) -- It's not shocking to see a woman talking on her cell phone while walking down the street. It is, however, shocking when the woman is an extra in a silent film from 1928.

He was last up for parole in 2010, when he was told his \"discretionary release remains inappropriate at this time and incompatible with the welfare of the community,\" according to the state's Division of Parole.

The statue, a gift to the city from the non-profit group Capital Area Statues, Inc., will be unveiled at 4:20 p.m. on April 20 as a nod to the country star's reputation as a stoner. The eight-foot tall, one-ton bronze statue was created by sculptor Clete Shields. \"Creating a sculpture of such an icon while he is still living presents its challenges,\" Shields said in a statement. \"For many, the Willie they connect with is the Outlaw Willie of the Seventies, or the influential advocate for Farm Aid in the Eighties, while others -- especially a younger generation -- grew fond of him during his more mature years.

An Air Force Academy graduate, Fontenot earned the Meritorious Service Medal, the Air Medal, the Aerial Achievement Medal, the Air Force Commendation Medal, the Air Force Achievement Medal and the Combat Readiness Medal, among others, for his service. He had more than 17 years of F-15 flying experience. He also completed active-duty assignments in Japan, Washington, Idaho, Florida and Alaska. He joined the Massachusetts Air National Guard in February. His body was found in the mountains near Deerfield Valley, Virginia, on Thursday evening, according to Lt. Anthony Mutti, spokesman for Barnes Air National Guard Base. The search for the single-seat aircraft was complicated by the remote, wooded location of the crash, near the Virginia-West Virginia border. Before losing contact, Fontenot had reported an in-flight emergency, according to Col. James Keefe, 104th Fighter Wing commander.\n\n# Formatting Instructions\nYou are a helpful assistant.

{"article":"Beijing (CNN) -- A high-speed bullet train collision in eastern China's Zhejiang province left 35 people dead and 210 injured, state-run news agency Xinhua reported Sunday. Witnesses told China National Radio that a bullet train stopped on the tracks Saturday because of a power outage from a lightning strike. Another bullet train traveling in the same direction rammed into the first train from behind and caused four of its cars to fall from an elevated bridge, the radio report said.

{"article":"Kabul (CNN) -- International forces in Afghanistan are investigating reports that civilians were killed in air strikes in the eastern province of Nangarhar, a spokesman for the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force said Saturday. The strikes Friday in Behsud District targeted five enemy combatants but an initial investigation did not confirm any casualties, Tech. Sgt. Peter Dean said. A spokesman for the governor of Nangarhar province said at least five people were killed following a NATO airstrike late Friday in Jalalabad.

Grandma Nelly -- AKA Illuminada Magtoto -- met Wade at the Heat practice facility for a little shoot-around. \"I want to play with you,\" said the grinning grandma who barely came up chest-high to the 6-foot, 4-inch guard. \"Now I'm 90.\" Wade appeared to be just as touched by the encounter. \"This gives me life. This gives me a purpose,\" he said after it was over. Wade sealed the date with a kiss on the hand. \"Oh my God,\" she squealed. \"I'm very, very happy. I'm very grateful,\" Nelly said. \"This is my dream come true.\"\n\n# Formatting Instructions\nYou are a helpful assistant.

{"article":"(CNN) -- Investors who say they were duped by a financier involved in a multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme can proceed with their lawsuits, after the Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled in their favor. The 7-2 decision is a further legal setback for Texas financier Allen Stanford and his business associates over the sale of about $7 billion in certificates of deposit. Allen was sentenced to 110 years in prison in June 2012 for orchestrating the $7 billion fraud, one of the largest in U.S. history. At issue was whether the federal Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 precluded any class-action lawsuits in state courts, alleging a misrepresentation. Former investors seeking to recover losses are suing insurance brokers, financial services companies and law firms associated with Stanford. The court majority said its opinion will not hamper the federal government's ability to go after financial fraud in its separate criminal prosecutions.

{"article":"(CNN)You're a backup dancer. This awards show is a big deal for you. You've been the one chosen to snatch a cape dramatically off Madonna during a musical number. It's going to be a moment you'll remember for all time. And now that it's happened, you'll remember it for a much different reason. Madonna was sent tumbling Wednesday night when the show didn't go as planned and she was yanked down a small flight of stairs. The 56-year-old singer says she's fine. The darn cape was just tied too tight. Here's what happened: Madonna was belting out \"Living for Love\" at the Brit Awards in London. It's a song that coincidentally includes the lyrics \"lifted me up and watched me stumble, after the heartache I'm gonna carry on.\" The plan was for the dancer to pull off the cape, but it was still tied around Madonna's neck.

This awards show is a big deal for you. You've been the one chosen to snatch a cape dramatically off Madonna during a musical number. It's going to be a moment you'll remember for all time. And now that it's happened, you'll remember it for a much different reason. Madonna was sent tumbling Wednesday night when the show didn't go as planned and she was yanked down a small flight of stairs. The 56-year-old singer says she's fine. The darn cape was just tied too tight. Here's what happened: Madonna was belting out \"Living for Love\" at the Brit Awards in London. It's a song that coincidentally includes the lyrics \"lifted me up and watched me stumble, after the heartache I'm gonna carry on.\" The plan was for the dancer to pull off the cape, but it was still tied around Madonna's neck. And down goes Madonna! If she was in pain, she didn't show it, getting back to her feet and finishing the number. Carry on, indeed.

{"article":"(CNN) -- A tornado touched down in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico, on Saturday afternoon, injuring at least four people and leaving the area without electricity, according to emergency officials. The twister struck Mayaguez, on Puerto Rico's western coast, at 12:35 p.m., according to Luis Correa, a spokesman for the State Emergency Department. Video showed twisted scaffolding and crushed cars, among other structural damage at a stadium set to host the 21st Central and Caribbean Games beginning Saturday night.
