Some of the problems are unauthorized use of power outlets, locked-up equipment, in-rush current, overloaded circuits, and the need of remote access to power outlets in the rack. The Switched Rack PDUs address these problems through individual outlet control, power on and off delays, current monitoring, alarm thresholds, and network management. Individual outlet control allows users to turn outlets on, turn outlets off, or recycle power to equipment, which can reboot locked-up equipment and avoid unauthorized use of outlets.\n\n# Formatting Instructions\nYou are a helpful assistant.
