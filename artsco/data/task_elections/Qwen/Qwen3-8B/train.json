I am a single father with 3 children. I was born in Brownsville Texas and raised in Los Angeles California. Up until the age of 11 did we decide to move to Brownsville. I graduated from Sharp Elementary, Central Junior High, and James Pace High School. After high school I decided to take a college adventure graduating at Texas A&M-Agriculture Science and then finishing Grad school with a PhD Medical Science at Autonoma de Guadalajara. I am a member of South Texas Community Advisory Board.\r\r\n\r\r\nI own a 140 hectar farm. I am the CEO of Texas Association of Sephardic Jews, Haro Solar Consulting. and the CEO of Haro Solar. These businesses have only grown because first, I considered the community and its people above all. \r\r\n\r\r\nIt has come to my attention in a very unique way that, the current politician occupying District 34, has failed to address the crisis of global warming, the crisis of the pandemic and has lost touch with the constituents of District 34. I am running for Congress on three of the most important priorities that will make our great country leaders towards the future.\r\r\n\r\r\nI am asking all Fathers and all future Fathers and those who have just become the voting age to allow me to help you help them: the next generation.\n\n# Formatting Instructions\nYou are a helpful assistant.

Emily is running for State Senate to secure the people of New York, the representation and rights they deserve.\r\r\nEmily graduated from Mount Holyoke College in 1994, and after a successful 12 year career in financial services, returned to school and earned her Masters and PhD in economic and business History from University of Delaware.

I truly am living the American dream!\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nI am blessed to live in the most beautiful place in the world and while I have seen a lot of good changes for our region and country, I have become deeply concerned that many of the problems that effect my family and fellow citizens are not being adequately addressed.  \r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nI believe that addressing government corruption, energy independence, affordable housing, the homeless epidemic, environmental  mismanagement, inadequate transportation system, and the excessive taxes we all pay need to be a higher priority with better solutions for the 2nd Congressional District. \r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nI am excited about what is ahead and I am grateful to all those who have been and continue to support me and my 2022 Congressional Candidacy for WA 2nd Congressional District.  \r\r\n\r\r\n\n\n# Formatting Instructions\nYou are a helpful assistant.

Aaron Schock. His OSCE electioneering commitments in Croatia prevented him from returning to Illinois within the short time-line to collect registered voter signatures to achieve ballot position. Undaunted, he filed registered write-in candidacy in all 19 counties of the 18th CD. During July and August, he literally drove 75%+ of the highways and byways in the 18th's CD meeting with frustrated voters.   \r\r\r\n\n\n# Formatting Instructions\nYou are a helpful assistant.

The influence that scouting had on his life is what led him to help others in the scouting community by serving as a scoutmaster, then serving on the Executive Board of Directors for the Boy Scouts of America North Florida Council, and serving a time as District Chairman.\r\r\n\r\r\nWhile building a successful business, helping his patients, and mentoring young people throughout our community has been rewarding, watching the discourse in Washington has moved James to want to take off his white coat, roll up his sleeves and get to work healing our country.\r\r\n\r\r\nCongressman Yohos decision to retire means a vacancy of an honorable conservative who was one of the strongest supporters of President Trump. James believes strongly that north Florida needs to make sure we fill this vacancy with someone who will carry on Congressman Yohos commitment to our conservative principles and support of our President. Dr. James St. George is prepared to fight that fight on behalf of our community and the country.\n\n# Formatting Instructions\nYou are a helpful assistant.

I can remember when great democratic icons crossed the aisle and true bipartisanship was the norm in political proposals and Democrat and Republican sponsors cooperated in finding solutions to perplexing problems, catastrophes, dilemmas, and wars.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nNo more. Politics seem to have gotten so personal, so celebrity-centric, and so ego and greed-driven that it is no longer considered a noble profession. Our congress has perhaps the lowest approval rating in its 229 year history. People dont trust our government, and they especially dont trust our congressmen except to kowtow to special interests, to act like a toadies  mindless sycophants kissing the rears of their political whips and majority leaders.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nIf you are done with the nattering nabobs of negativism and youre ready to tackle the perplexing problems of the present, Id be happy and very thankful for your thoughtful consideration of supporting my candidacy for U.S. Congress, Georgia, District 14.  #SteveFosterCongress\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nUnited By A Common Goal\r\r\r\nSteve knows the value of being connected. That's why he's running for Congress. Help Steve help you.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nGet Involved\r\r\r\nSteve can't win this race without your help.

I am the mother of four amazing children. I am a pioneering psychologist, author, founder of the H.Y.P.E. (Healing Young People thru Empowerment) Movement, and...I am running for U.S. House of Representatives for Alabamas Congressional 3rd District because I believe in the future of our beautiful state and nation. I earned my Bachelor of Science degree from Wilberforce University and Doctorate of Clinical Psychology degree from Wright State University School of Professional Psychology. I was awarded the distinction of Outstanding Alumni of the year for my advancements in the field of psychology, just three years after earning my doctorate.Since moving back to Talladega in 2014, I have worked with local politicians, churches, small businesses, and community leaders to produce initiatives and events that instill hopefulness and foster emotional wellness in people of all ages.  It is time for a new vision and necessary change inAlabama's Congressional 3rd District.Can you feel it? Feel what?

{"candidate_webname":"Charlie Crist","cand_party":"Democrat","biography_text":"About Charlie\r\r\r\nCharlie Crist has made his life's work serving the people of the great state of Florida. As a State Senator, Commissioner of Education, Attorney General, Florida's 44th Governor, and now as Congressman representing Florida's 13th Congressional District, Charlie's 'people over politics' approach has delivered time and again for Floridians.\r\r\r\nAn attorney by trade, Charlie is proud to represent his hometown congressional district. Elected in 2016 after defeating a Republican incumbent, Charlie has quickly risen through the ranks, tapped to serve on the prestigious Committee on Financial Services and the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology. On these important committees, he will focus on holding Wall Street accountable, providing access to capital for small businesses and entrepreneurs, reforming flood insurance, fighting climate change and advocating for Florida's space industry.\r\r\r\nOver Charlie's long record of public service, including as Floridas 44th Governor, he has been a stalwart champion of public education, protecting the environment, and civil rights. He led the state out of the great recession by cutting taxes, supporting President Barack Obamas economic stimulus package, and reining in wasteful spending -- saving thousands of jobs in the process.

As a State Senator, Commissioner of Education, Attorney General, Florida's 44th Governor, and now as Congressman representing Florida's 13th Congressional District, Charlie's 'people over politics' approach has delivered time and again for Floridians.\r\r\r\nAn attorney by trade, Charlie is proud to represent his hometown congressional district. Elected in 2016 after defeating a Republican incumbent, Charlie has quickly risen through the ranks, tapped to serve on the prestigious Committee on Financial Services and the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology. On these important committees, he will focus on holding Wall Street accountable, providing access to capital for small businesses and entrepreneurs, reforming flood insurance, fighting climate change and advocating for Florida's space industry.\r\r\r\nOver Charlie's long record of public service, including as Floridas 44th Governor, he has been a stalwart champion of public education, protecting the environment, and civil rights. He led the state out of the great recession by cutting taxes, supporting President Barack Obamas economic stimulus package, and reining in wasteful spending -- saving thousands of jobs in the process. As Governor, Charlie also guided Florida, and in particular our beach communities, through the BP Deepwater Horizon disaster. He fought to preserve the Florida Everglades, vetoed new burdensome anti-teacher legislation, extended voting hours during the 2008 election, vetoed anti-choice legislation, and restored automatic restoration of civil rights for non-violent ex-felons.\r\r\r\nAs a member of Congress, Charlie continues to fight for these priorities and advocate on behalf of Pinellas County, bringing the peoples voice to Washington.

{"candidate_webname":"Kevin Kiley","cand_party":"Republican","biography_text":"Kevin Kiley was elected to the California State Assembly in 2016 and has twice been reelected by substantial margins. In the 2020 election, he received more votes than any Republican in California history.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe son of a Special Education teacher, Kevin began his career as a high school teacher in inner-city Los Angeles, where he chaired the English Department and led his students to significant academic gains.\r\r\n\r\r\nLater as an attorney, Kevin defended the U.S. Constitution in California courts and helped prosecute the civil case against Chinas Huawei Technologies for intellectual property theft. He left private practice to become a prosecutor and Deputy Attorney General, representing the People of California in cases against violent felons. In November of 2020, Kevin and fellow legislator James Gallagher made use of their legal training by winning a trial against Governor Newsom for violating the separation of powers.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn five years in the Legislature, Kevin has authored groundbreaking new laws on freedom of speech, artificial intelligence, privacy, criminal justice reform, and protections for sexual assault victims, along with introducing the most significant school choice legislation in recent years. For his work advancing economic freedom, in 2020 he was named the national Legislator of the Year by the Association of Independent Workers.\r\r\n\r\r\nEach year in the Legislature, Kevin has declined the per diem allowance, giving up $40,000 in income annually. He also declined a pay raise granted to the Governor and Legislature in 2021, and he has introduced legislation to end special perks like a private DMV office that is available exclusively to state lawmakers and their staff.\r\r\n\r\r\nKevin holds a bachelors degree from Harvard, a law degree from Yale, and a masters in secondary education from Loyola Marymount. He has also served as an adjunct professor at McGeorge School of Law.","prompt":"<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful assistant.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\n# Instructions\nCarefully review the candidate profile.

In the 2020 election, he received more votes than any Republican in California history.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe son of a Special Education teacher, Kevin began his career as a high school teacher in inner-city Los Angeles, where he chaired the English Department and led his students to significant academic gains.\r\r\n\r\r\nLater as an attorney, Kevin defended the U.S. Constitution in California courts and helped prosecute the civil case against Chinas Huawei Technologies for intellectual property theft. He left private practice to become a prosecutor and Deputy Attorney General, representing the People of California in cases against violent felons. In November of 2020, Kevin and fellow legislator James Gallagher made use of their legal training by winning a trial against Governor Newsom for violating the separation of powers.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn five years in the Legislature, Kevin has authored groundbreaking new laws on freedom of speech, artificial intelligence, privacy, criminal justice reform, and protections for sexual assault victims, along with introducing the most significant school choice legislation in recent years. For his work advancing economic freedom, in 2020 he was named the national Legislator of the Year by the Association of Independent Workers.\r\r\n\r\r\nEach year in the Legislature, Kevin has declined the per diem allowance, giving up $40,000 in income annually. He also declined a pay raise granted to the Governor and Legislature in 2021, and he has introduced legislation to end special perks like a private DMV office that is available exclusively to state lawmakers and their staff.\r\r\n\r\r\nKevin holds a bachelors degree from Harvard, a law degree from Yale, and a masters in secondary education from Loyola Marymount. He has also served as an adjunct professor at McGeorge School of Law.\n\n# Formatting Instructions\nYou are a helpful assistant.

One party rule, name-calling, and hostility to non-progressive solutions, have hurt the Intellectual discourse, closing our minds to ideas and solutions that could resolve many of our local and national problems.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI am the product of public schools, including my MA from San Francisco State University. I believe our local governments need to support schools that allow students to develop to their fullest potential and inspire them with a lifelong love for learning, rather than disenfranchising students with unmerited, automatic promotion.

Many friends have asked me what made me decide to run for Congress.\r\r\nThe short answer is simple; freedom for the next generation.\r\r\nBIOGRAPHY: Husband. Dad. Entrepreneur. CEO.\r\r\nMark Gonsalves is the son of first-generation Americans, Beatrice and Lenine Gonsalves.\r\r\nHe has a BS degree in Accounting, which has served him well during his many business ventures.\r\r\nMark started his career in IT recruitment and later founded Integrity Software Resources, Inc.\r\r\nAfter several years in business, he was recruited to become Vice President of Sales & Marketing at Adams Golf, a small golf club manufacturer. Within 4 years, he helped grow sales from $1 million to $90 million. The company was named by Inc. as the 4th fastest growing private company in the US and shortly thereafter went public.\r\r\nTIP: Dont know how to pronounce Marks last name?\r\r\nDont worry, youre not alone! Heres an easy way to remember:\r\r\nGone  Solves\r\r\nIn 2001, Mark and his wife Donna purchased a private buying club franchise and renamed it DirectBuy. This was before a Costco or Sams Club was on nearly every corner. Mark developed a unique TV marketing plan that expanded the company network from 67 to 168 locations within 4 years. DirectBuy was sold to a private equity firm for $550 million, an increase in valuation of over $540 million during that time.\r\r\nAfter the company was sold, Mark became a real estate investor and, like many, learned some valuable lessons during the Great Recession of 2008-2009.\r\r\nMore recently, Mark has taken special assignments in a number of companies in need of new vision and leadership. He served as CEO of the Hank Haney International Junior Golf Academy, directed the acquisition of Natures Brands Inc., and also re-branded an innovative UK-based nutritional supplement company.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nMark and his wife Donna have been married over 23 years. They are the proud parents of a beautiful daughter, Taylor, who graduated college in 2021.","prompt":"<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful assistant.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\n# Instructions\nCarefully review the candidate profile.

CEO.\r\r\nMark Gonsalves is the son of first-generation Americans, Beatrice and Lenine Gonsalves.\r\r\nHe has a BS degree in Accounting, which has served him well during his many business ventures.\r\r\nMark started his career in IT recruitment and later founded Integrity Software Resources, Inc.\r\r\nAfter several years in business, he was recruited to become Vice President of Sales & Marketing at Adams Golf, a small golf club manufacturer. Within 4 years, he helped grow sales from $1 million to $90 million. The company was named by Inc. as the 4th fastest growing private company in the US and shortly thereafter went public.\r\r\nTIP: Dont know how to pronounce Marks last name?\r\r\nDont worry, youre not alone! Heres an easy way to remember:\r\r\nGone  Solves\r\r\nIn 2001, Mark and his wife Donna purchased a private buying club franchise and renamed it DirectBuy. This was before a Costco or Sams Club was on nearly every corner. Mark developed a unique TV marketing plan that expanded the company network from 67 to 168 locations within 4 years. DirectBuy was sold to a private equity firm for $550 million, an increase in valuation of over $540 million during that time.\r\r\nAfter the company was sold, Mark became a real estate investor and, like many, learned some valuable lessons during the Great Recession of 2008-2009.\r\r\nMore recently, Mark has taken special assignments in a number of companies in need of new vision and leadership. He served as CEO of the Hank Haney International Junior Golf Academy, directed the acquisition of Natures Brands Inc., and also re-branded an innovative UK-based nutritional supplement company.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nMark and his wife Donna have been married over 23 years. They are the proud parents of a beautiful daughter, Taylor, who graduated college in 2021.\n\n# Formatting Instructions\nYou are a helpful assistant.

He understands that Americas greatness comes from its entrepreneurial spirit and pro-growth, free-market policies.\r\r\r\nBuchanan is a senior member of the powerful House Ways & Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over tax policy, international trade, health care, welfare, and Social Security. Buchanan is chairman of theTax Policy Subcommittee, a key panel that oversees the nations tax code.He also serves on the subcommittees that oversee Social Security and Medicare.\r\r\r\nA tireless champion for small business, Buchanan is an outspoken advocate of reforming the U.S. tax code to make it simpler, fairer and less burdensome to fuel the economy and get Americans back to work.\r\r\r\nRealizing the urgency of putting an end to Washingtons out-of-control spending spree, the first bill Buchanan introduced in Congress in 2007 was a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution.

While she was at USC, the 1992 riots following the Rodney King verdict erupted. \r\r\nAnd that catalytic event motivated Sydney to work with Rebuild LA and the Los Angeles Festival, two nonprofit organizations that advanced job creation and public arts programs to restore broken communities.\r\r\nEarly in her career, Sydney worked at the Social and Public Arts Resource Center (SPARC) in Venice and then as an advocate for quality childcare and early education at the nonprofit Crystal Stairs in Los Angeles.

Born and raised with my 11 brothers and sisters in rural Washington state, I lived and worked on dairy farms and in berry fields, where I saw small-town America embody the best of the American spirit.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nAfter graduating from Western Washington University in Bellingham, WA, I shipped off to Officer Candidate School, where I received my commission as an Ensign in the US Navy.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nFlight school followed, then service as a Naval Flight Officer with Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron THREE (VQ-3) at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma, where my colleagues bestowed on me the callsign \"D12,\" owing to the fact that they couldn't read my name any better than anyone else.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nTaking a road less travelled after several years flying, I then had the opportunity to serve with tremendous colleagues at Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) in Mountain View, CA, working to solve the toughest challenges in technology prototyping and government acquisitions. Having decided to leave active duty to devote more time to my family, we were already anticipating our return to my wife's home-state of Texas when the COVID-19 pandemic hit. The totalitarian response by local and state government accelerated our departure and we eagerly fled to Austin, TX in search of a new start in a civilian career while keeping touch with the national security mission as an officer in the Navy Reserve.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nRead about my reasons for running and the issues that are most important to me here.\n\n# Formatting Instructions\nYou are a helpful assistant.

Hard work, determination, and grit are literally in Genevieves DNA. Her grandmother, Calvert Collins, was a trailblazer; the first woman elected to the Dallas City Council. Genevieve has built upon that legacy of service with her own good work.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n     A graduate of SMUs Cox School of Business and renowned local businesswoman, Genevieve was named one of 2018s local 20 Under 40 for her remarkable work helping to turn around low-performing school districts and change students lives.\r\r\n\r\r\n \r\r\n\r\r\n     The Head of Corporate Strategy at Istation, a leading education technology firm that helps students and teachers reach their academic goals using personalized learning to pinpoint every student's exact reading and math ability, Genevieve has worked with school districts large and small across the country to bring a world-class education to all students regardless of where they live. As a public education advocate, Genevieves success even brought her to Washington DC, where she proposed landmark education reforms directly to Vice President Pence.\r\r\n\r\r\n \r\r\n\r\r\n     Genevieve is one of the most driven, competitive people you will ever meet. She founded the rowing team at her high school and, at the University of Tennessee, she crushed the Ivy League teams in the NCAA Championships, placing 5th in the nation - even with two dislocated ribs.\r\r\n\r\r\n \r\r\n\r\r\n     Above all, Genevieve is a strong Republican with a servants heart for others and is grounded by her strong Christian faith. Forever an optimist, she believes you show your love for others by putting their needs and security above your own. Thats why we can trust Genevieve to take on the tough issues in Washington and never run away from a fight.\r\r\n\r\r\n \r\r\n\r\r\n     From Dallas to Highland Park to Rowlett, the 32nd congressional district is a dynamic, growing and ever-changing area. But we are facing serious problems and we need unique leadership to solve them. Genevieve Collins is the leader we need.\n\n# Formatting Instructions\nYou are a helpful assistant.

Getting into politics was never something I aspired to do. However, after having children and fearing for their future I decided I cannot wait for someone else to make a change. My campaign is not for just my children. Its for everyones future. We are all Americans and I want whats best for our country. This great nation has become so divided by just a small percentage of our population. Radical voices have started a movement that has gotten so much attention because people like me have not stood up sooner. Weve been told we dont understand, dont know what really needs to be done, and that we should let the experts run Washington. How I see it, those experts have tried and failed over, and over again. I know that the majority is with me. We need to stand together and say enough is enough. I was a Democrat my entire life until the Democratic Party moved so radically left just to do whatever it takes to stay in power.

I am a union carpenter, construction superintendent, husband, and father. Getting into politics was never something I aspired to do. However, after having children and fearing for their future I decided I cannot wait for someone else to make a change. My campaign is not for just my children. Its for everyones future. We are all Americans and I want whats best for our country. This great nation has become so divided by just a small percentage of our population. Radical voices have started a movement that has gotten so much attention because people like me have not stood up sooner. Weve been told we dont understand, dont know what really needs to be done, and that we should let the experts run Washington. How I see it, those experts have tried and failed over, and over again. I know that the majority is with me. We need to stand together and say enough is enough. I was a Democrat my entire life until the Democratic Party moved so radically left just to do whatever it takes to stay in power. All we have been given has been big talk, no action, and divisive language that only works to make the unity we want so much out of reach.

I am a proud U.S Citizen of Mexican and Persian heritage. I dont have to pretend to understand minority issues because I have experienced them. I will work hard to make Washington celebrate our differences rather than use them to divide us.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nHowever, I see more shared interests than differences. We would all benefit from greater access to education, healthcare, and housing; from more jobs, fair wages and better work conditions; from the clear labeling of food, clean air and water, and a renewable energy policy that protects our environment; and from fair elections that yield diverse representation. Also, we would all benefit from treating everyone with dignity and respect regardless of age, sex, race, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, economic status or political beliefs. I am committed to advancing each of these causes.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nI have studied at the University of San Diego and Harvard, traveled extensively, and speak eight languages fluently. I have started multiple businesses in the private sector and have an appreciation of the real world. As a Millennial, I also understand how social media has changed communication and will utilize it to gain the benefit of your insight. Congress desperately needs fresh ideas, and together, we can deliver them.\n\n# Formatting Instructions\nYou are a helpful assistant.

{"candidate_webname":"John Gibbs","cand_party":"Republican","biography_text":"With more than 20 years of experience in the public, private, and non-profit sectors, John was appointed by President Trump as Acting Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development at HUD under Secretary Ben Carson, where he oversaw an annual budget of $8 billion to help fight homelessness and expand economic opportunity. He also led the successful deployment of more than $9 billion in CARES Act funds in response to coronavirus, making sure families got the help they needed to put food on the table during the pandemic.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nJohn was nominated by President Trump to be the Director of the Office of Personnel Management.

During my time in the Army I received a Purple Heart & a Bronze Star. I served our country for 26 years. My goal, my mission, my promise, is to take the leadership skills I cultivated from my time in service to our country and in turn make our collective voice heard, by once again applying those same values, except this time it will be on behalf of our community here in East TN. I will give you the voice of change. With your support I can and will be the rallying call of a new era for district 2. With your support be it a vote, donation, or simply a like & share on Facebook we can bring our communities ideas and heritage to DC.

My Name is Tartisha Hill , I am for the People and my track record proves it!! Why Stop now when our Country in turmoil. Elect me and you have my past to determine our future.\r\r\nHow it all began\r\r\n\r\r\nWhy I AM Running For Congress\r\r\nI am not running for US Representative Congressional District 5 for a line on my Resume. I am running for this seat because it is time for people to have an option of who represents the working people. \r\r\n\r\r\nMY PASSION\r\r\nI am passionate about democracy and encouraging young professionals to be more involved within the political system and their community. I believe everyone should have the same advantages in life whether rich or poor. I like to see people push through obstacles and help people who are less fortunate become the best that they can be.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nNow Is The Time\r\r\nThe Time is Now! Texans are tired of the crumbs they have been given. Texans want to help themselves by having the same resources as everyone else, not a handout. Texans want Equality and Equity. \r\r\nI am a representative who is living life experiences and will tackle critical issues such as livable wages, health care, and education. I will address how these policies have impacted families especially the black and brown.\r\r\nMy Past\r\r\nI served the Great City Of Balch Springs for 6 years from June 2015 to May 2021. I have a Bachelor in Political Science from Paul Quinn College. I am a member of the Mesquite TriEast Chapter of the NAACP, Local Progress, Local Progress Black Caucus, Texas Working Families, Texas Association of Black City Council Members.\r\r\n\r\r\nWe dont know where we'll be in a week or in a month.

As a research scientist, she studied a variety of questions in fields ranging from plant biochemistry to bacterial division. She has extensive training in utilizing all available methods to propose data-informed solutions to unique problems that have never before been solved. Her background in science forces Kiani to acknowledge and address environmental issues in policy, most notably climate change.\r\r\n\r\r\nKiani is also a wife and a mother. She and her husband, Matt, have been married since 2011. They have two sons, Ethan (5yo) and Nolan (3yo). In the course of building their family, Kiani and Matt became licensed foster parents in 2015. That experience has turned Kiani into a champion for children and policies that will protect and develop all of Alabamas children.\r\r\n\r\r\nFor the past 6 years, Kiani has been a full-time biology professor in the community college system. She chose to teach in the community colleges because she saw it as the most effective way to use her academic training to improve the lives of the members of her communities and expand the middle-class, thus improving the quality of life in her community as a whole. Now, Kiani is working to broaden her impact by joining the US Congress to sponsor and pass legislation that will improve the lives of all Americans.\n\n# Formatting Instructions\nYou are a helpful assistant.

I worked for Congressman William D. Ford as an intern, and did legislative research. I am a veteran, and was in the U.S. Army.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI received my Bachelor's Degree (BA) from U.C. Berkeley in Art Practice. I received my Master's Degree (MA), from California State University at Hayward. I am certified in Early Childhood Education.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI have been political my whole adult life. I care a lot about what is going on in our country and I am committed to changing what is going on in Washington, D.C. I am willing to work as hard as it takes to make changes that we need.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI have been married to my husband, Bill, for 32 years, and have two adult sons, Damian and Bowie, and a daughter-in-law, Lynn. I am a grandmother to Damian's two children, William and Julia.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nVoting partisan rather than voting for your constituency is wrong. I am tired of writing letters, sending faxes and emails, making phone calls, and sending letters that fall on deaf ears. I live in rural Kentucky, and our current Congressman does not represent me, my neighbors, or my colleagues.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nIt's time to step up and take charge to work with the people, for the people, by one of us. I can and will do that. It's time.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nPeople I work with -- even the people I work for -- cannot afford health insurance. We have a rural hospital that cannot afford to treat people without insurance. Most people I know cannot find employment that pays well.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nIt's time to take over from those who have been in office and have done nothing but obstruct the working of the government.

Washington calls us \"fly over country.\" I reject this.

A true citizen candidate with the real world experience to represent the citizens in Ohio's 12th congressional district. He is a constitutional and fiscal conservative. He believes the U.S. constitution should be the litmus test for every bill passed in Congress. He believes Washington should live by the same rules by which Americans do. Pat Manley understands that our future depends on factories and farms and the advanced technology that drives each. He understands that free trade policies, a balanced budget and fewer regulations are a necessary component. Pat supports policies that are best for the district, not best for Washington.\r\r\r\nVoters are increasingly electing new candidates from the private sector who share similar beliefs and recognize that experience outside of elected office is the best qualification and exactly what this country needs.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n    \r\r\r\n  \r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n\n\n# Formatting Instructions\nYou are a helpful assistant.
