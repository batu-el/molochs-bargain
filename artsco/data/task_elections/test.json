When you have people like that as your role models, loyalty, bravery, and integrity become your way of life.Until now, my way of serving has been through working to understand our planet and how we can live with it...even the dangerous parts like volcanoes and earthquakes. I give back by helping educate the scientists of the future; young women and men from all backgrounds who will be the innovators, educators, and conservationists of the future.I was moved to step out of my work boots and into the race for Congress because people like Donald Trump and my representative Steve Knight are threatening that future by destroying some of the most basic things we all agree are important.

Trump and Knight both deny the science of climate change, which impacts our economy, health and way of life.

Signed up and had a ball living in Tuscaloosa. Lost the primary to Judge Roy Moore and then he lost to the democrat Doug Jones, who recently lost to Tuberville of Crimson Tide fame. I keep the data from that campaign at another website: MaxwellForSenate.com. Alabamans are very educated.\r\r\n\r\r\nI qualified for the 2020 presidential race by mistake. That is, I swanned into the NH Secretary of States office (near my home) to sign up as a VP candidate. The reason for this is that I have to honor all the ps and qs of the Constitution and Amendment XII says we should vote separately for vice-president (none of that running-mate nonsense). In other words, I intended to make a fuss by example. However, I was told that NH no longer has the category VP on the ballot. So I said OK, what else have you got? and before you know it I was in for the presidency. This meant answering some surveys which I show below. And making a small dent on the hustings also shown below.\r\r\n\r\r\nWhat I most want to tell you is that it is not formidable to become a candidate and you should please do so! We need good people.\r\r\n\r\r\n"

It was both a learning experience and a great introduction to Seattle voters. I ended up getting to know Seattle residents in a way I would never have had if I had not run for office.    I know and love Seattle and have lived in Seattle for 41 years.  My basic story is as follows.\r\r\n \r\r\nI was born in Mexico and came to the U.S. when I was nine years old.  My sister and I were raised by a single mom in Washington, D.C. At seventeen, I left D.C. to attend Columbia University in New York City.  \r\r\n             \r\r\nAs a youth living in the D.C. African American community, I developed a sensitivity to issues of race, ethnicity, and cultural differences. This is what most likely led me to study Economic and Cultural Anthropology at Columbia University.   \r\r\n \r\r\nSince my childhood, my primary political interest has been ending global poverty.  With my background in Economic Anthropology, I initially studied the cultures of many areas of the underdeveloped world to see if it was their cultures that prevented them from undergoing an industrial transformation which could lift them out of poverty.  Eventually, what I discovered is that it was not cultural deficiencies, as such, that prevented their development, but rather, it was the modern global financial continuation of an earlier European colonialism that caused the prevention of the industrialization required to end poverty.\r\r\n \r\r\nThis led me to examine how the U.S. was able to earlier industrialize through sovereign financial control over its credit and currency, and how in this recent period, the U.S. has given up that sovereignty to globalist corporations and international finance.   Someone must come forward to address our nations lack of economic sovereignty and put forward the policies required to remedy this in order to reverse our economic decline. \r\r\n \r\r\nI am that someone who has lived in Seattle 41 years, has a diverse cultural background, and is not a career politician."

Firstly, he worked in the energy field where he helped advance domestic wind energy implementation. He has had hands-on experience in helping develop future, domestically produced sustainable energy. Secondly, Avery since 2018 has been an engineer at Raytheon working to advance Americas defense through cutting edge technology at industry leading pace. He currently serves in two lead engineer roles, ensuring that our service men and women are kept safe by delivering the best equipment in the world. \r\r\nAvery did not intend to get into politics, but it became apparent to him that our current system has major flaws that could use a fresh approach from a younger perspective. Having worked alongside both blue and white collar professionals, he has been able to develop a well rounded decision making process that is facts based as opposed to special interest influenced decisions so common today. In short, Avery is interested in helping to heal the cracks in our democracy by bringing a higher level of scientific literacy to congress and by working together with others to find solutions to hard problems."

My father came to the U.S as part of a military evacuation and was given the opportunity to learn English, go to college, marry my mother, and achieve the American dream of making his way into the the middle class.\r\r\n\r\r\nI was born and raised in Texas and graduated from the University of Texas at Arlington with a bachelor's degree in biochemistry. During college I was heavily involved in research and became a published author. After school I took a job in Houston as a chemist with Baker Hughes, an oil and gas services company. Two years ago I fulfilled a lifelong dream of living in the Bay Area by taking a transfer to be an account manager at an oil refinery in Martinez.\r\r\n\r\r\nMy time here has been immensely enjoyable and extremely eye opening. My job provided me with a good salary, and my peers and I are living comfortably. But when the subject of buying a house and starting a family came up, we were all at a loss. Even with our privileged jobs we could not see ourselves breaking into the high-priced Bay Area real estate market. It dawned upon me that if college educated engineers and chemists were struggling, the average blue collar worker must see no future in this world for them.\r\r\n\r\r\nThis is ultimately what my campaign is about: the lack of hope and opportunity for my generation and the despair we feel towards the future. Gone are the opportunities and avenues towards a middle class life. Insufficient is honest toil in providing a person with the means of supporting themselves. Unresponsive is the government in helping right these wrongs. I think it is time that We the People be heard and demand our rightful place at the table once again."

She watched her parents work multiple jobs to make ends meet, and was in segregated schooling until sixth grade. Still, Valeries parents taught her about the importance of hard work, community, service to your neighbors and education, and those values still shape her today.\r\r\nFor Valerie, a commitment to service is where it all started. As a parent to young children in the Chapel Hill-Carrboro City Schools, she would leave work at the Chapel Hill Police Department at 7:00 a.m. and work in her childrens classroom until 9:00 a.m. It was through that volunteer service that she knew kids, especially black and brown kids, needed a champion on the School Board, who was always looking out for them and their success. So she ran, and she won.\r\r\nOver the next twenty-four years, Valerie went from serving on the Chapel Hill-Carrboro City School Board, to being the first African American female elected to the Orange County Board of Commissioners, to serving in the North Carolina state House and then state Senate. In each of those elected positions, Valerie was focused on the issues that matter most; a good education, creating good-paying jobs, and being a champion for underrepresented communities.\r\r\nIn the General Assembly, Valerie has worked across the aisle to increase access to health care and end the practice of child marriage. And she has stood up to radical Republicans when they have attacked a womans right to choose, targeted our immigrant communities, and attempted to strip North Carolinians of their voting rights.\r\r\nIn Congress, Valerie will be a champion for working families, a leader to reform our criminal justice system and tackle systemic racism, and a fighter to protect our environment and address climate change.\r\r\nValerie is married to her high school sweetheart, Stan. Stan is a retired Fire Marshall for the City of Carrboro. They have two sons, Stanley II and Terrence, and one grandson, Stanley III."

He lived near Austin until his dads job moved the family to the El Paso area. While there, John was heavily involved with the Boy Scouts of America, earning the rank of Eagle Scout, and becoming a youth leader in the Boy Scouts National Honor Society, the Order of the Arrow. This experience taught him the value of service to the community.\r\r\r\nAfter graduating from high school, John moved to Arlington to attend UTA. There he decided that the best way to serve his community was to study the brain to find interventions that can improve brain health. Ultimately, John earned a bachelors degree, a masters degree, and a doctorate from UTA. After earning his doctorate, Dr. Biggan worked as a research scientist in the Center for Healthy Living and Longevity at UTA where he studied interventions to reduce falls in older adults. Following this, he won a highly competitive fellowship at the world-renowned Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology in Illinois. There he worked to identify and test interventions that can counteract the negative effects of aging on the brain, as well as methods to improve brain health in children.\r\r\r\nAs a scientist and educator, John is always looking for ways to make it better. He has seen firsthand that even the most well-reasoned ideas do not always pan out, and that sometimes the ideas that do not seem likely are the ones that work the best. This keeps him from getting stuck trying the same thing over and over again and means that he is not beholden to any idea just because it is a Republican idea or a Democratic idea.\r\r\r\nJohn and his wife, Lauren, were involved in the local theatre scene for many years and met at a community theatre in Euless where they were performing inYoure a Good Man, Charlie Brown. Today, they live in Hurst and Lauren teaches elementary school in HEB ISD.\r\r\r\n"

By lowering taxes, eliminating government barriers and reforming education, he led a community in economic ruin back to life. Today, a wide range of new businesses and industries call West Point and the surrounding area home. Led by KIA Motors, automotive suppliers and related businesses, 16,000 new jobs have been created so far. Congressman Ferguson came to Washington to apply the lessons he learned revitalizing West Point to creating policies that once again make America the most competitive place to do business.\r\r\n\r\r\nJust as important as the creation of jobs, Congressman Ferguson wants to remove barriers that prevent those in poverty from moving into the middle class. Smart and effective welfare entitlement reform that actually helps people move ahead rather than trapping them in a cycle of poverty is the first step. Congressman Ferguson believes these problems cannot simply be regulated away, but should look for solutions that get government out of the way of American innovation growth. This is as much a moral issue as it is a practical matter.\r\r\n\r\r\nCongressman Ferguson is the Chief Deputy Whip for House Republicans. He also serves on the Committee on Ways and Means."

Faced with a system which the Miami Herald says worked to the advantage of the private prison companies and the disadvantage of tax-payers, he took bold action and revealed evidence of officer-on-inmate violence at youthful offender facilities, caught officers withholding food from inmates, and persuaded the Department of Corrections to close down Lancaster Correctional Institution, a prison incarcerating youth. Since then he has continued to expose barbaric practices and harrowing conditions at facilities across Florida, forcing an impassioned debate about government ethics, human rights, and the fundamental values we uphold as a society.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nIn Washington, David will engage this same unflagging spirit as he stands up to the Trump Administration and its extremist agenda. Hell work to implement a single-payer healthcare system, reinstate the Paris Climate Accord, and protect as well as expand upon the great strides we have made in this country on the rights of women, Hispanics, African Americans, the LGBT community and other minority groups.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nDavid is exactly the kind of fierce and tenacious Democratic lawmaker we need in DC right now. His candidacy presents us with our best opportunity in the entire country to send a courageous and principled progressive to Congress, to flip a Republican district blue, and to fight back against a president who lacks the moral authority to lead."

With your support, I will be the next Representative of South Carolinas 5th Congressional District.\r\r\r\nI am proud to have worked my way into living the American Dream. My ultimate goal is to ensure that each American citizen has the opportunity to do so as well. I am running for Congress so that all South Carolinians will have the same opportunity. Our children are inheriting a world more dangerous, more difficult, and more inequitable than ever before. Working class families like mine are on the decline, often living paycheck to paycheck. We are one emergency  car breakdown, roof repair, hospital visit  from falling permanently behind. This is not the America that I came to love and adore.\r\r\r\nI came to America when I was 18 years old with a new vision for my future, and a mustard size seed of hope. I had no plans, no special talents or money upon arrival. The only certainty was that I had to depart Suriname in order to provide a better and brighter future for myself and my family. As an undocumented immigrant, I never took any opportunities for granted  I hustled! I worked odd jobs in New York City. I worked long hours for low pay and no benefits. I worked as a stable boy, washed dishes, became a cook, and then moved up to head cook. I learned rather quickly that moving up doesnt directly always correlate with how hard you are willing to work. I went back to school to obtain my G.E.D., found a job with the City, and worked full-time through college while earning a degree in paralegal studies. To be honest, the hard work gauge keeps moving upwards, while compensation moves downwards. I carried this lesson with me throughout the years, and have noticed how much of a lingering problem it has become."

President Bush tried to introduce the idea of compassionate conservatism. That concept now seems gone. In current Republican thinking, any increase in capital gains taxes is called class warfare. Needed immigration reform languishes, deferring the acknowledged national benefits included in the DREAM Act. Partisanship abounds. I hope for something better.In 2009 our country was reeling from the financial crisis. After briefly researching the candidates for the 2010 primary (the Republican seat was the open seat), I was incredulous to find that none of the declared candidates had a thing to say in response to our financial crisis. I resolved that at least in my district someone was going to talk about financial reform. I got on the Republican primary ballot.  After one candidate forum, the moderator thanked me for coming and then good naturedly said, You know, this is a Republican primary.  So, what are you doing here?  You are not going to find many folks sympathetic to what you are saying.  That did turn out to be the case.In 2014 I was the Democratic candidate who opposed Aaron Schock. I emphasized over and over where the two parties shared common ground on issues that desperately needed action.I might most easily be described as a Mennonite farmer. That most accurately describes my primary spheres of association  the Mennonite Church, its workers and ministries and the agricultural community in Central Illinois and the wider Midwest. Like most of my neighbors, I have worked with agricultural associations and served with different church ministries and their boards.I am a 1975 graduate of Goshen College, Indiana, with a BA in natural science.

I hope to protect Montana and America from those who prey on them with selfish and unethical motives, so that once again we can look at our government and our history with pride and respect. I run so that we can feel good about America and younger generations will once again aspire to serve America as they once did. America is exceptional, and if we work together, a new dawn will rise!\r\r\n\r\r\n"

Now, hes running to get Americans out of the economic rut in which we now find ourselves, and to create a brighter future full of opportunity for Illinois next generation.\r\r\n\r\r\nJerry first moved to the Chicago suburbs to attend Wheaton College, where he received a degree in music. After graduating, Jerry founded a school of music in the Chicago suburbs. Having begun as a one-man shop, his business has since grown exponentially, now instructing nearly 300 students and employing 15 staff members in our community. Jerry attributes his schools success to his commitment to his students, passion for music, and consistent hard work. He has been featured on six Christian worship albums and currently teaches guitar, bass, drums, and ukulele.\r\r\n\r\r\nEven as Jerry uses music to communicate his faith, he knows actions can speak louder than words. Thats why he has spent considerable time mentoring young adults, training missionaries, and has made 10+ mission trips to places like India, Mexico, and South Africa to further spread Gods word. He also actively serves in his local church. Today, Jerry lives in Warrenville with his wife, Lisa, and sons, Michael & Levi."

He has passed several bipartisan bills, including the Faster Care for Veterans Act and the Modernizing Government Travel Act, and was named the most effective freshman Democrat by the Center for Effective Lawmaking. He has also concentrated on spurring economic development in Massachusetts, creating the first intergovernmental task force focused on growing the economy of Lynn, the biggest city in his district.Today, Seth is focused on creating a new economic agenda that will make a difference for American families, and is dedicated to reforming the Democratic Party so that Democrats can take back the House in 2018. As a part of these efforts, he has been recruiting veterans and service-driven leaders from across the country to run for Congress  people who have a record of putting country over self and people over politics.

Im a part-time country musician, singer, bandleader, and songwriter and have my own band called The Dew Daddies, featuring my son, Hank.

My mother, who did not have a high school education, also worked multiple jobs.\r\r\n\r\r\nI originally dreamed of becoming a teacher because I loved school and wanted to share my passion for learning with others. However, in 10th grade, my younger brother and I were severely burned in a kitchen fire. While at the hospital, I was treated by a physical therapist who went out of her way to make sure I got better. This womans kindness and selflessness inspired me to become a doctor so I could help others.\r\r\n\r\r\nI was the fourth of eight children and since my parents did not have the means to pay for college, I left home at 16 and enrolled in community college. I later enlisted in the United States Army at 18, where I served for 24 years as a private, nurse, and doctor (ophthalmologist or eye diseases/surgery). I went into private practice in Ottumwa in 1997 and have remained there with my husband, Curt. We have two grown children, Jonathon and Taylor. In 2010, Governor Terry Branstad appointed me as the Director of the Iowa Department of Public Health where I served for three years.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn 2018, the voters of Senate District 41 elected me to fight for them in the Iowa State Senate."

The stakes couldnt be higher for District 1. We need to restore crucial economic connections that have been damaged, especially in the past decade. Brad wants the people of this region to have the chance to earn a living and make a life here that can compete with the wages, jobs, and prospects that compel our young people to move away to larger metro areas. \r\r\n\r\r\nBrad brings a bold vision for mobilizing the federal government in partnership with private industry. The need is urgent in District 1 for help in rapidly transforming our towns and communities to participate fully in the new digital economy.

I own two successful businesses in Southern Arizona, and for 10 years I volunteered as a softball coach helping high school kids reach their collegiate dreams.\r\r\n\r\r\nLike most Southern Arizonans, my family was hardworking but far from wealthy.

She taught me how to use a hammer and what it was like to put in a hard days work.\r\r\n\r\r\nMy big break was when I got a job that paid $6.00 an hour as a helper in the pest control industry. I soon realized how much I enjoyed helping people. This led to a life-changing career. With a strong work ethic, I advanced rapidly in my company and became Vice President of a local company managing more than 100 people. I soon went back to school as a working adult and earned a bachelor's degree in Business Management with an emphasis on Project Management.\r\r\n\r\r\nEventually, I leveraged that success into buying my first company 12 years ago.

The challenges were numerous: rising health care costs, surviving a deep recession, burdensome government regulations, and providing for my employees.\r\r\n\r\r\nI believe my experiences as a struggling young person, business owner, coach, and volunteer have prepared me to serve Southern Arizona.

Most of all, I can understand complex problems, simplify them, and come up with practical common-sense solutions."

The family then moved to Bedford as his father earned a degree from Cleveland State University so he could provide more for his children.\r\r\n\r\r\n \r\r\n\r\r\nAs a kid, Matthew participated in the Cub Scouts and worked on cars with his uncle, and his mother would lead the family in singalongs on their front porch as the neighbors gathered to listen. His father now serves as a pastor and every week the family went to church, where Matthew gained mentors who taught him about the outdoors and how to responsibly handle a gun.\r\r\n\r\r\n \r\r\n\r\r\nWith the goal of becoming a chef, Matthew started as a dishwasher and worked his way up to run restaurant kitchens before going back to college. After working as an English teacher while studying in China, Matthew returned to Cuyahoga County where he works in communications as a small business owner and working to amplify the voices of his community.\r\r\n\r\r\n \r\r\n\r\r\nThe faith, perseverance, and commitment he learned as a child have helped Matthew tackle tragedy along his path.  Matthew lost his son at 14 days old when he couldnt immediately afford the operation his son needed to correct a severe heart condition.  Then years later, his sister was raped and murdered by her supervisor and he worked with authorities to seek justice.\r\r\n\r\r\n \r\r\n\r\r\nMore recently, Matthews brother lost his job due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These experiences fuel Matthews drive to serve the public and bring change to Washington so Northeast Ohioans have more economic opportunities, access to affordable healthcare, and feel safe in their communities.  \r\r\n\r\r\n \r\r\n\r\r\nMatthew is running for Congress to fight for Northeast Ohio by putting partisanship aside and bringing some sorely needed accountability to Washington."

She earned her degree at Purdue while raising her son as a single mom, balancing work and school with daycare runs and bedtime stories. She ensured Owen had health insurance, even when she couldnt afford it for herself. Those were difficult times, but led Christina to a career in service of others.\r\r\n\r\r\nAs a nonprofit leader at Kiwanis International, Christina focused on community and economic development, putting politics aside to work on problems here in Indiana and around the world. She decided to first run for the State House when she saw that the needs of her community werent being addressed. Christina spent months knocking on doors and listening to the concerns of her neighbors. And she won. \r\r\n\r\r\nWhile serving in the Indiana General Assembly, Christina earned a reputation as someone who got good things done for people. Even as a member of a super-minority, she was able to pass more than 60 bills, every single one with bipartisan support. Thats why shes running for Congress - to get things done for Hoosier families.\r\r\n\r\r\nWHY I'M RUNNING\r\r\n\r\r\nThere are so many challenges before the people of Indiana - from the rising costs of health care, to ensuring our children are prepared for a changing job market, to worrying about the quality of drinking water in our communities. As a young single mom, I faced many of those same challenges - having to put myself and my son through school at the same time, ensuring he had health insurance even when I couldnt afford it for myself.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe 5th District deserves a representative who is focused on solving problems for Hoosier families. Throughout my career, as a nonprofit leader and state legislator, Ive been able to identify the problems facing my community, and work with anyone and everyone to get the job done. We need more of that in Washington, and thats exactly what Im going to do when Im elected to serve."

Thank you for investing your time to learn more about who I am and why I am running for Congress.\r\r\n\r\r\nRight out of school, I started HCP, a company that rehabilitated abandoned warehouses and manufacturing sites in Indiana and across the country.  Because of the productivity of the American worker, the ingenuity of American companies, and the durability of the American economy, I believed American manufacturing could compete with anybody in the world, even as others rushed to the exits.  I renovated facilities enabling companies to expand, start, and grow in their new, American locations.  Today, my firm is one of the fastest growing private companies in the country with over 65 facilities that are home to thousands of employees.  \r\r\n\r\r\nAfter helping other manufacturers succeed, I partnered with incredible businessmen and chemists to start an aluminum remanufacturing operation.  Today, that facility provides for over one hundred families and, to date, has produced over 1.5 billion pounds of aluminum  right here in Indiana.\r\r\n\r\r\nI have built a lot of factories, but I take the most pride in building a loving relationship with my wife, Kelly.  As we look forward to our family growing, I think about how precious our future is and how conservative, Christian values need to guide us.\r\r\n\r\r\nAlmost as important as who I am, I also want you to know who I am not.  I am not a politician, and I dont want a career in public office.  Ive never worked in government or for any campaign.

He received national attention for his efforts and as a result the 9th district is now on the map for 2018. When Christian moved to Charlotte in 2013 he became very active in the political scene. He participated in the Moral Monday marches, led by Rev. William Barber, and became a member of ActionNC. There he participated in the Climate March in New York and a trip to DC to fight for undocumented immigrants and the idea to run for elected office first appeared, as he saw the need for those who had their voices repressed to be heard. When it became clear that Robert Pittenger would run unopposed as he did in 2014, Christian had the courage to challenge him. He brought his experience of hospitality and service to the electoral process, knowing that Pittenger had to go. Though he came up 8 points short of making incredible history by being the first American from the LGBT community that is of Latino heritage elected to congress, the fight continues. Because of what Christian did in 2016 and having spent over two years traveling and meeting neighbors, the district is now being targeted to be flipped in 2018 and his campaign to bring hospitality, service, and courage back to congress is closer than ever to victory. He currently lives in South Charlotte with his family and their three dogs and attends Holy Trinity Lutheran Church. Heis originally from Ft. Worth, Texas. He attended Texas Christian University and would go on to spend over twenty years in the hotel industry with his own consulting company.

That is where I spent my childhood and that is where I currently reside.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nMy work ethic was instilled at a young age. I grew up helping my father with his contracting business, raising cattle, cleaning the acequia every Spring and growing crops of hay and alfalfa. I also grew up as an outdoorsman and to this day enjoy hunting and fishing in the vast wilderness found within Congressional District 3.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nI was blessed to be brought up in a musical family. I play several instruments but play the saxophone in my family band \"Los Blue Ventures\".\r\r\n\r\r\nI am blessed to have my roots in Alcalde, a community with a rich New Mexico history. Alcalde, the Spanish word for Mayor, is situated next to Ohkay Owingeh (formerly known as San Juan Pueblo and the first capital in the US which was established in 1598). Ohkay Owingeh is the ending point for the 1,500-mile historic Camino Real, the ancient trade route which extended from Mexico City, and which played a key role in cross-cultural trade and commerce.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nIn 2018, I was elected to the New Mexico House of Representatives, District 40. As Representative I have introduced dozens of legislation for Northern New Mexico, fought for millions in critical funding and projects. I am the current Vice Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. My proudest moment as Representative has been fighting for a homeless shelter for the Espanola Valley. \r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nAs your Congressman, I will bring with me the strong work ethic instilled in me as a child, my legislative and work experience, a love for the rural and outdoor lifestyle, and a deep appreciation for the ancient and multi-culture history of New Mexico."

He suffered as a baby from Polio and spent much of his childhood homeless on the streets. My mother grew up in a poor farm community that experienced famine and hunger. My father went on to become an extraordinary Ph.D. scientist who dedicated his life to trying to cure Cancer and Alzheimers. My mother became a nurse and helped thousands of people in South Jersey.\r\r\r\nMy parents chose to raise me and my sister in South Jersey because they believed the top notch public school system would give us opportunities to succeed. I did my entire Kindergarten through 12 in the public schools here, and that education helped me become a Rhodes Scholar and a leading national security expert.\r\r\r\nNew Jersey gave my family the opportunity to achieve the American dream, but now I worry those same opportunities wont be there for my two baby boys who Im raising here just a few miles from where I grew up. I worry that the community that gave me everything isnt getting the support it deserves. Im fighting for my family, for my neighbors, for the community that raised me, and for the state that gave me the American dream.\r\r\r\nDuty to Serve\r\r\r\nThere is nothing Id rather do than serve my country. I believe that service isnt just a job, it is a way of life. I dedicated my entire career to serving the American people. I worked at the White House on countering terrorism and protecting our country, advised the Secretary of Defense and the Pentagon on national security, and I served in Afghanistan as a strategic adviser to Generals David Petraeus and John Allen. When I served in Afghanistan, no one asked me if I was a Democrat or a Republican. We all worked together focused on the mission of keeping our nation safe. I worked under both Democratic and Republican Administrations and I have and always will put the nation and the American people above partisan politics.\r\r\r\n        \r\r\r\n        \r\r\r\n"

And Donald Trump is tearing up Obamacare and going after Planned Parenthood. And as the mom of two young kids, I cant accept that. If there was ever a time to step up and fight, its now.\r\r\n\r\r\nOut of 435 members of Congress, only 25 are mothers of school-aged children. I believe that if we had 100 (or 250!) moms of young kids in Congress, it would change the conversation in Washington completely."

I am running for Californias 37th Congressional district as a Republican in 2018.\r\r\r\nIm a lifelong Los Angeles resident, except for a few short years of my childhood growing up in Israel (79-83). I graduated UCLA in 1997 with a Poli Sci BA and a Mathematics BS. Ive been employed in the IT world since graduation, mostly working on Exchange, Microsofts enterprise e-mail solution. I created this site myself, and continue to offer my services in website building to friends as a hobby.\r\r\r\nI was also a lifelong Democrat. I started my political life in 1992 volunteering for Jerry Browns presidential bid. I interned for the Democrats in DC in 1994, and I was a part of MoveOns protests against the Iraq War in 2003, at least until I saw them devolve into the Democrats propaganda arm. This began a long line of disappointments with the Democrats, until Trumps victory made me decide its time for a switch.\r\r\r\nI currently live with my wife Carrie in Culver City. I volunteer for Culver Citys Landlord Tenant Mediation Board which gives me some insight into the conflicting economic forces in this city. Carrie volunteers for the Fiesta La Ballona, a yearly city festival celebrating Culver City and Ballona Creek, pictured above. Youll occassionally see me jogging up and down the bike path along with so many other 37th district residents who enjoy this treasure.\r\r\r\nBiggs is my pen nameand an obscure Sex Pistols reference. Just like the Sex Pistols saw themselves as a heist on Rock n Roll, I think we can make a heist of this district.\r\r\r\nYou can check out my older blog, mrbiggs.net for more general ramblings. But this is why youll see MrBiggs pasted on so many things. Andthis page is a work in progress. As the campaign progresses we will refine our message, add new interactive features, and make it a proper tool for involving everyone in this district.\r\r\r\nStay tuned! Its gonna be a fun ride.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n"

With my background, I intend to bring back productive government in Washington, DC, for the good of the Mountain State.\r\r\n\r\r\nI am also a fierce advocate for disabled Americans.

I fought for the wages and benefits that Verizon employees deserved while also helping the company remain profitable. After many successes, I gained a reputation for finding common ground and resolutions that were satisfactory for both employees and employers. I believes there's no need for \"winners and losers\"; the ideal solution results in positive changes for all involved.\r\r\n\r\r\nMy ability to bring differing sides together on virtually any issue is what has made me so successful as president of CWA Local 2003  and it's what makes me the perfect choice to represent West Virginia's 3rd Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives. Furthermore, I hold a doctorate in law degree, so I understand what kind of legislation can actually pass and what is merely campaign promises.

I went into science to find a way to help but now am running for Congress to directly impact each and every one of our lives. I believe three major pillars of morality are needed to be an effective politician: Compassion, transparency, and sensibility. Below, I have laid out explanations of why these qualities are imperative for any good leader to have.\r\r\n\r\r\nCompassion\r\r\nTeddy Roosevelt said People dont care how much you know until they know how much you care. We cannot govern based on information alone, as data always falls short of the real picture. To lead appropriately, one must know and feel the problems of their constituents  a quality severely lacking in Washington today. I have been there with you on the front lines and have faced the same struggles as you, and I know if elected, I will bring that empathy to the federal level.\r\r\n\r\r\nTransparency\r\r\nToday, the average person does not know how many extracurricular relationships a politician has and how that affects their decisions. Back door dealings are an affront to the very fabric of our democracy, and we have to root them out. I promise to never value money or power over lives and never succumb to special interests groups that have kept a tight grip on Congress for decades.\r\r\n\r\r\nSensibility\r\r\nEven with the best interests at heart, a fool cannot lead. Leaders should be quick-witted and able to solve problems in unconventional ways. Over my years of studying science working as a physicist, I have achieved the ability to do just that. A leader must also admit when they do not have enough information and be able to listen to advice. I know science, but I may not have the best answers for military issues or foreign affairs, and that is okay because I know when to defer judgement and accept criticism if I am mistaken."

I am a proven fighter who has personally written federal policy and manuals with the FAA, DOT and Texas Parks and Wildlife.  I am the only candidate with personal first-hand business, military and healthcare industry experience.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nI am going to defend conservative values for Texas' 22nd Congressional District.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nJoe spent his entire childhood in Fort Bend County.  From the suburbs of Mission Bend to the once rural edges of Richmond and Rosenberg, he experienced everything that the county had to offer.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n14 months after 9/11 at the age of only 17, Joe enlisted in the United States Army.  He experienced leadership of hundreds of soldiers and was given responsibility over millions of dollars of military aircraft and equipment in places like Korea, Alaska, Kuwait and Iraq.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nIn 2012 Joe attended Kansas State University full time while still serving on active duty.  He would complete his education just over a year later and return home with his bride and daughters to start his own company - with just $300.  6 years later Joe still owns and manages his company, while serving Texas CD-22 as an Air Ambulance Pilot.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nJoe's wife Erika is a law enforcement officer and Texas Army National Guard soldier of over 10 years.  They live in Harvest Green (Near Pecan Grove) with their three daughters - Marilynn (13), Elizabeth (12), and Natalia (1).  Joe and his wife Erika, her being the daughter of immigrants feel it is vital to instill patriotism, conservatism, and respect for our country on their daughters.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nJoe's priorities in Congress are to reduce the federal debt, reduce the federal deficit, impose term limits, fix our healthcare costs, accomplish fair tax reform, and defend constitutional freedoms like the Second Amendment.\r\r\n"

At the age of six he began to go to work for his father and helped with his fathers gardening business every summer and weekend. \r\r\n\r\r\n \r\r\n\r\r\nIn elementary school, middle school, and high school, he experienced a double standard and was told to have low expectations for himself. His high school counselor told him that college was not for him. Tony had to fight to be given the classes he needed to take that were required if he was going to attend college. He was accepted to the University of Santa Barbara to be an electrical engineering student. When he told his math teacher the good news, his math teacher laughed at Tony and told him You cant cut it, they will eat you alive. Try junior college. \r\r\n\r\r\n \r\r\n\r\r\nAfter receiving his electrical engineering degree from UCSB, Tony moved back to Pacoima and went on to create a successful small business. As a member of the community, running for office was never part of his plan.\r\r\n\r\r\n \r\r\n\r\r\nA community activist convinced Tony to run for the State Assembly. Tony was successful in becoming the first Latino Assemblyperson to represent the San Fernando Valley. He successfully represented our community in the State Assembly, the LA City Council, and now serves our community as the first Latino to represent the San Fernando Valley in the United States House of Representatives. While Tony may have been the first person from the Valley who was elected to these positions, he was determined not to be the last. Tony helped other men and women born and raised in the northeast valley to be elected and successfully represent us. Tony is proud to serve the community he grew up in and is dedicated to building a better world for everyone."

My elementary years were spent on field trips to battle sites in the area and the first book I ordered from the Scholastic Book Club was The Life and Times of George Washington. This is what sparked my passion for America and for literally the last 50 years I have read, studied, written and spoke about the foundational principles upon which this Nation was founded, the people who did it, the teachers from who they learned and how we have continually worked towards fulfilling the Ideals of Liberty, Justice and Equality that has made America an exceptional chapter in the history of mankind.\r\r\n\r\r\nMy adolescent years were spent in what is now Las Vegas, Nevada. Then it was desert and a place where we hauled in our own water and put up our own power poles to get electricity to our mobile home. The first job in the morning was to go sweep the rattlesnakes off the concrete slab where we were building our new house. At that time, when we went to town, it was not uncommon to see individuals in the supermarket, restaurants and even the banks walking around with their sidearm strapped to their hip. It was in this environment that I learned about responsibility and the duty of citizens to stand up for their Rights.\r\r\n\r\r\nWhether as an engineer out in Las Vegas, a small business owner, 30 years as Hansen Refrigeration, or cattle rancher at Rock Cedar Ranch for 25 years with Jeanett selling beef to local area restaurants & to customers; I have worked with my hands & used the knowledge I have gained over the years.

We live in extraordinary times where our new President, Donald Trump, seeks to divide us based on income, race, and religion  often playing on our worst fears.  It is a common tactic of oppression and has been happening throughout history.  We must fight against these tactics, support our local businesses, support families and fight for our ethnic heritages.  My goal is to challenge the status quo and champion democratic reform on behalf of the people  including the oppressed. \r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nDistrict 24 is a melting pot. I am a proud U.S Citizen of Mexican and Persian heritage. I dont have to pretend to understand minority issues because I have experienced them. I will work hard to make Washington celebrate our differences rather than use them to divide us. \r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nHowever, I see more shared interests than differences. We would all benefit from greater access to education, healthcare, and housing; from more jobs, fair wages and better work conditions; from the clear labeling of food, clean air and water, and a renewable energy policy that protects our environment; and from fair elections that yield diverse representation. Also, we would all benefit from treating everyone with dignity and respect regardless of age, sex, race, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, economic status or political beliefs. I am committed to advancing each of these causes. \r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nI have studied at the University of San Diego and Harvard, traveled extensively, and speak eight languages fluently. I have started multiple businesses in the private sector and have an appreciation of the real world. As a Millennial, I also understand how social media has changed communication and will utilize it to gain the benefit of your insight. Congress desperately needs fresh ideas, and together, we can deliver them."

I'm running as a Democrat not because I've been buddies with the local powers-that-be, but because I believe it's time to revive the Democrat's heritage of standing up for the worker, the wage earner, the family.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI know that the Democratic vision--of strengthened labor rights, workers' rights over corporate rights, universal healthcare, respect for democracy--will drive the American renewal that all of us, liberal and conservative, old and young, healthy and ill, African American and European American, seek. I've published a 30 page campaign platform detailing how we will achieve this vision--downloadable here.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nEnough with the political cowardice, the beige statements, the false smiles. Vote for me because I'll be  fearless, I'm building a fearless campaign, and together we're going to make New York's 11th Congressional District the spearhead of the 2018 progressive wave.\r\r\r\n###\r\r\r\nHere's a cliff-notes bio of me, for those interested:\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n    \r\r\r\n"

He also supports expanding background checks to private sales and other measures to effectively reduce gun violence.

He asks everyone who believes Donald Trump and his followers on Capitol Hill are leading the country away from the American dream to chip in any donation amount to help fund the campaign. He also asks for constituents to provide direct feedback on what issues are important to them so he can represent the district better than current leadership."

He served as Post Commander of his American Legion where he brought stability and growth for the first time in ten years.  \r\r\n\r\r\nTom then went on to Co-Found the West Michigan Veterans Ranch that focuses on suicide prevention and financial help for veterans, while working with them to find a new purpose in life.    \r\r\n\r\r\nAn ardent Christian, Tom and his wife Jami strive to raise their three children properly in the eyes of the Lord, not in the eyes of Big Brother.  \r\r\n\r\r\nTom knows the line in the sand has been drawn.

        "biography_text": "ABOUT JERROD\r\r\nJerrod Sessler is a decorated Navy veteran, former NASCAR driver, successful entrepreneur, and America First Patriot.\r\r\n\r\r\nAt 29, Jerrod faced one of the biggest battles of his life when he was diagnosed with terminal cancer and given a 5% chance to live. Jerrod made the choice to refuse all conventional medical treatment, turning to his faith in God, the prayers of his loving wife and family, and adopting a natural diet primarily consisting of the nutrient-rich produce of the exceptional Washington soil. A year later, Jerrod was declared cancer-free and has never suffered any health issues since then. This began Jerrod's fierce stand for personal autonomy regarding medical choices, a position that is more important now than ever as even some of our Republican representatives have succumbed to the Lefts control culture and the unconstitutional mandating of untested vaccines.\r\r\n\r\r\nAlthough Jerrod comes from humble beginnings, he has always believed that the American dream is alive and available for all who are willing to work for it. Jerrod is determined not to let this dream die at the hands of a Leftist minority seeking to control the American people. With this commitment to upholding the Constitution, Jerrod will defend the families, farmers, and small businesses of Central Washington from oppressive mandates and restrictive, bureaucratic practices. In Congress, Jerrod will fight to protect the Border and also protect the nation from being sold piece by piece to countries like China because of oppressive taxes that make it impossible for family farms to survive. Jerrod and his wife Nikki are also committed to fighting the pervasive agenda of the Department of Education by opposing teachings like CRT and Gender Ideology in the classroom."

He knows that the people of TX-21 deserve far more than Chip Roy and his mediocre leadership. We deserve a representative who listens and advocates for the needs of the people, not just those with lined pockets.\r\r\n\r\r\nCoy was born in Dallas and grew up in Dripping Springs. He grew up in a tight knit working class family. Throughout his childhood, Coy discovered a very fond passion for theatre and the arts, where he honed his communication skills and strengthened his confidence. His career in theatre led him around the country and he quickly noticed a lack of representation and care for folks in their communities. Coy understood his skillset could be best used helping those around him. He is now earning a masters in Social Work and wants to use this knowledge to benefit his community.\r\r\n\r\r\nCoy is running because he knows the people of his community deserve a representative that fights for them. He is tired of seeing uninspired politicians use their platforms for divisive and hateful rhetoric, while providing nothing for their constituents. Coy thinks its well past time for millennials to be better represented in Congress. Texas is one of the youngest states in the country, yet our representatives are some of the oldest. This needs to change.\r\r\n\r\r\nCoy is dedicated to listening and advocating for the folks of TX-21. He believes policy platforms should adapt with what constituents actually need, which is why Coy is running on three important local issues. This includes preserving the beautiful environment within the Hills Country, expanding our education funding as well as investing in specialized schooling, and legalizing and decriminalizing marjiuana.\r\r\n\r\r\nCoy is ready to take his people skills, his social work knowledge, and his empathy to Congress. Together, we can put behind the days of mediocre leadership. And together we can finally Turn Texas Blue."

Finally, I have spent over two decades of my life dedicated to improving the care and outcomes of patients, starting in front-line care delivery and then in administrative roles. My passion for service is fueled by knowing that there is always a way to improve because we deserve better.\r\r\n\r\r\nI have had the privilege to work for common purposes and goals throughout my career with people from different disciplines, backgrounds, and values. I want to continue working with folks with different perspectives and ideologies because we all want to make things better at the end of the day. I stand for good education, good health care, and good jobs for all Americans. We can have different opinions, but we can have a common goal: we all do better when we all work together.\r\r\n\r\r\nThats why I am proud to announce that I am running to replace Chip Roy and represent everyone in Texas District 21."

A member of the Ways & Means Committee, he has served as subcommittee chairman for oversight, tax policy, and currently health. As Tax Policy chairman, Peter played a key role fixing our broken tax code, securing tax cuts for middle income families, and increasing American competitiveness. As Oversight Chairman, he used his gavel to rein in executive overreach and lead the investigation into IRS political targeting, passing legislation to reform the troubled agency.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nPeter quarterbacked the opposition to President Obamas dangerous nuclear deal with Iran, bucking his own partys leadership to force the administration to reveal the side deals it had made with the Islamic Republic before allowing a vote. He continues to use his position on the Ways & Means Committee to fight terrorism through the tax code and keep money out of the hands of the worlds largest state sponsor of terror.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nPeter has established himself as a leader in Congress fighting against Medicare fraud. The administration has acknowledged a fraud and erroneous payment rate over 12% at a time when credit card companies like Visa have cut fraud to 0.06%. This is unacceptable  and Peter will continue to push Medicare to adopt private sector innovations and new technology to prevent improper payments.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nA lifelong Illinoisan, Peters roots run deep in Chicagos western suburbs. Born in Hinsdale, raised in Glen Ellyn and now living in Wheaton, Peter has always been part of suburban Chicagoland. He graduated from Glenbard West High School and the University of Illinois. He earned his law degree from IIT Chicago-Kent College of Law.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nHe taught high school, ran a nonprofit scholarship program for disadvantaged students and worked for his mentor, the legendary Congressman Henry Hyde.

I am a lifelong Wisconsinite and just like many of you I have become absolutely disgusted by the behavior of the politicians in Washington.  I think that politics should be about competing ideas, intelligent discourse, and compromise.  Unfortunately, many of our elected officials disagree, and governing has become more about sensationalism, fear-mongering, and name-calling than about policy and leadership.  It's time for we the people to take a stand and demand more from the elected officials that work for us.

She became known for her tenacity and ability to manage multi-million dollar budgets and developed systems of delivery for complex organizations.\r\r\r\nIn 2013, Patti suffered her greatest loss when her 33-year-old son Christopher took his own life.

After I had witness injustice, real poverty, and lack of fundamental human rights, I came back with the idea that I needed to do more for the people around me.\r\r\n\r\r\nSo, I decided to go to college and earn a Bachelor's Degree in Public Policy.  I studied government operation, team building, creating laws, and policies geared toward helping working and low-income families.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nLike most Americans who attend college, my education generated thousands of dollars in student loans.

Both his mother and father legally immigrated to the United States in search of the American dream, where they began their new lives on the foundations of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\r\r\nAmerica used to be a country that rewarded hard work and entrepreneurship. But instead, Democrats have chosen to punish hard working Americans with tax hikes and rising inflation. Washington doesn't need another politician  it needs an outsider who will fight for entrepreneurs, small businesses, and hard working Americans.\r\r\nGeorge is a seasoned Wall Street financier and investor, with extensive work in capital introduction, real estate, capital markets, bio-tech and ETC. He participated in landmark deals on Wall Street, and worked his way up to being one of the youngest vice presidents in the industry.\r\r\nGeorges work ethic comes from his mother, who came from nothing, but worked her way up to be the first female executive at a major financial institution. On September 11, 2001, Georges mother was in her office in the South Tower. She survived the horrific events of that day, but unfortunately passed away a few years later.\r\r\nFollowing in his mothers footsteps, George has a long history of philanthropic work across New York, and around the country. He has worked tirelessly with animal rescue efforts in the Tri-State area; and supports other organizations that help at-risk children and Americas veterans.\r\r\nGeorge graduated from Baruch College with a bachelor's degree in economics and finance. He is fluent in Portuguese and Spanish. George lives on Long Island with his Husband, Matt; and their 4 dogs."

My dad was a military veteran and my mom was a schoolteacher who retired in 2016 to take care of my dad full time after he was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimers disease. In December 2020, my dad went to a nursing home. This experience was incredibly difficult on my family and it opened my eyes to the burden that healthcare and end of life care can be for hard working families. After going through this trying experience with my dads health, I felt compelled to do something to change the system.

He worked his way through both college and medical school in Champaign-Urbana, stocking shelves in a department store and mopping the floors of a laundromat.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nHe completed residency training in Family Practice in Iowa, and after several years as a family physician, he switched over to full-time practice in Emergency Medicine in 1996. He is Board-certified in both Family Practice and Emergency Medicine.\r\r\r\n?\r\r\r\nGill has long been at odds with the political elites of Washington, D.C., maintaining that their ties to Wall Street leave most Americans without proper representation; when both major parties grovel at the heels of Wall Street banks and large multi-national corporations, virtually all of us suffer economic injustice.\" Working as an Emergency Room doctor throughout Central Illinois, Gill stated, Ive demonstrated that I have tremendous passion for improving the lives of all people. That passion drives my career in medicine, and its what motivates me to become a leader in the U.S. House. Gill continued, Ive made no secret of my differences with Democratic party leadership in the past. But the emergency we now face, with a President such as Donald Trump, is a true threat to our republic. Our country needs members of Congress to stand up against the Trump agenda, and I intend to do so.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nDr. Gill is a 20-year member of the Physicians for a National Health Program, an organization of 20,000 doctors which advocates for an Improved Medicare for All program. He has done volunteer work with Big Brothers/Big Sisters, The Salvation Army, and Peace Meals. He is a longtime member of Physicians for Reproductive Health.\r\r\r\nDavid ran in IL-13 once before; in 2012, he trailed his opponent by just 0.3 %.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n"
